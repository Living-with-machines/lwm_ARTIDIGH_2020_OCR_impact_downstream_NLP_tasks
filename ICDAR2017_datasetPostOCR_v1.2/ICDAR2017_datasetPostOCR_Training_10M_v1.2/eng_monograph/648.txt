[OCR_toInput] OF FRYER BACON. 209 Time is for some to sing, Time is for some to pray, Time is for some to creepe, That have drunke all the day. Time is to cart a bawd, Time is to whip a whore, Time is to hang a theefe, And time is for much more. Do you tell us copper-nose, when time is, I hope we SchoUers know our times, when to drinke drunke, when to kisse our hostes, when to goe on her score, and when to pay it, that time comes seldome. After halfe an houre had passed, the head did speake againe, two words, which were these time was. Mdes respected these words as Httle as he did the former, and would not wake them, but stdl scoffed at the brazen head, that it had learned no better words, and have such a tutor as his master and in scorne of it sung this song. TO THE TUNE OP A RICH MERCHANT MAN. Time was when thou a kettle wert fill'd with better matter But Fryer Bacon did thee spoyle, when he thy sides did batter. Time was when conscience dwelled with men of occupation Time was when Lawyers did not thrive, so well by mens vexation. VOL. I.
