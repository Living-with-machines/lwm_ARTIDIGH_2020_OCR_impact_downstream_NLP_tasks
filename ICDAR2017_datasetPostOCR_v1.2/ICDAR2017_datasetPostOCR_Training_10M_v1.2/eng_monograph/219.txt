I've often wished that I had clear For life six hundred pounds a year, A handsome house to lodge a friend, A river at my garden's end, A terrace-walk, and half a rood Of land, set out to plant a wood Well, now I have all this and more, I ask not to increase my store But here a grievance seems to lie, All this is mine but till I die I can't but think 'twould sound more clever, To me and to my heirs for ever. If I ne'er got or lost a groat By any trick or any fault And if I pray by reason's rules, And not like forty other fools, As thus, Vouchsafe, oh gracious Maker, To grant me this and t' other acre Or. if it be thy will and pleasure, Direct my plough to find a treasure ! But only what my station fits, And to be kept at my right wits Preserve, Almighty Providence ! Just what you gave me, competence, And let me in these shades compose Something in verse as true as prose. Removed from all ambitious scene. Nor puffed by pride, nor sunk by spleen. -Swift
