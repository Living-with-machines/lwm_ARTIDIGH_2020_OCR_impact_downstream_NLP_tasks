[OCR_toInput] SECT. I. THE PARSON. 9 Upon his feet, and in his hond a staf. This noble ensample to his scheep he yaf, That first he wroughte, and afterward he taughte, Out of the gospel he tho wordes caughte, And this figure he addede eek therto, That if gold ruste, what schal yren doo ? For isa prest be foul, on whom we truste, No wonder is a lewed man to ruste And schame it is, if that a prest tak keep, A filthy schepherde and a clene scheep Wel oughte a prest ensample for to vive, By his clennesse, how that his scheep schulde lyve. He sette not his benefice to hyre, And leet his scheep encombred in the myre, And ran to Londone, unto seynte Poules, To seeken him a chaunterie for soules. Or with a bretherhede to ben withholde But dwelte at hoom, and kepte wel his folde, So that the wolf ne made it not myscarye He was a schepherd and no mercenarie. And though he holy were, and vertuous. He was to sinful man nought despitous, Ne of his speche daungerous ne digne, But in his teching discret and benigne. To drawe folk to heven by fairnesse By good ensample, this was his busynesse But it were eny persone obstinat, What so he were, of high or lowe estat, Him wolde he snybbij scharply for the nones. A better preest, I trowe, ther nowher non is. He waytede after no pompe and reverence, Ne makede him a spiced conscience, But Cristes lore, and his apostles twelve, He taughte, but first he folwede it himselve. - Chaucer
