[OCR_toInput] SECT. II. ANGEL HELP. 473 CCCLXVIII. ANGEL HELP. This rare tablet doth include Poverty with Sanctitude. Past midnight this poor Maid hath spun, And yet the work is not half done, Which must supply from earnings scant A feeble bedrid parent's want. Her sleep-charged eyes exemption ask, And holy hands take up the task Unseen the rock and spindle ply, And do her earthly drudgery. Sleep, saintly poor one, sleep, sleep on And, waking, find thy labour's done. Perchance she knows it by her dreams Her eye hath caught the golden gleams, Angelic presence testifying, That round her everywhere are flying Ostents from which she may presume That much of Heaven is in the room. Skirting her own bright hair they run, And to the sunny add more sun. Now on that aged face they fix, Streaming from the crucifix The flesh-clogged spirit disabusing, Death-disarming sleeps infusing, Prelibations, foretastes high, And equal thoughts to live or die. Gardener bright from Eden's bower, Tend with care that lily flower Suggested by a drawing in which is represented a poor female who, having spun past midnight, to maintain a bedridden mother, has fallen asleep from fatigue, and angels are finishing her work. In another part of the chamber, an angel is tending a lily, the emblem of purity.
