[OCR_toInput] BK. IV 408 AN ENGLISH ANTHOLOGY. We, in thought, will join your throng, Ye that pipe and ye that play, Ye that through your hearts to-day Feel the gladness of the May ! What though the radiance, which was once so bright, Be now for ever taken from my sight, Though nothing can bring back the hour Of splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower ? We will grieve not, rather find Strength in what remains behind, In the primal sympathy Which having been, must ever be In the soothing thoughts that spring Out of human suffering In the faith that looks through death, In years that bring the philosophic mind. 1 1. And oh ye fountains, meadows, hills, and groves, Think not of any severing of our loves ! Yet in my heart of hearts I feel your might I only have relinquished one delight, To live beneath your more habitual sway. I love the brooks, which down their channels fret, Even more than when I tripped lightly as the ' The innocent brightness of a new-born day Is lovely yet The clouds that gather round the setting sun Do take a sober colouring from an eye That hath kept watch o'er man's mortality Another race hath been, and other palms are won. Thanks to the human heart by which we live Thanks to its tenderness, its joys and fears To me the meanest flower that blows can give Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears. - Wordsworth.
