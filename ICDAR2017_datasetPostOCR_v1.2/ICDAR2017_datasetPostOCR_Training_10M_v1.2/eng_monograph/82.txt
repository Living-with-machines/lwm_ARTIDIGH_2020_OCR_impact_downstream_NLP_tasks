[OCR_toInput] SECT. II. THE SEVEN DEADLY SINS. 41 But joyd weake wemen's hearts to tempt, and prove If from their loyall loves he might them move Which lewdnes filld him with reprochfull pain Of that foule evill, which all men reprove, That rots the marrow, and consumes the braine. Such one was Lechery, the third of all this traine. And greedy Avarice by him did ride, Upon a camell loaden all with gold Two iron coffers hong on either side, With precious metall full as they might hold And in his lap an heap of coine he told For of his wicked pelfe his God he made, And unto hell himselfe for money sold Accursed usury was all his trade, And right and wrong ylike in equall ballaunce waide. His life was nigh unto death's dore yplaste And thred-bare cote, and cobled shoes, hee ware Ne scarse good morsell all his life did taste, But both from backe and belly still did spare, To fill his bags, and richesse to compare Yet childe ne kinsman living had he none To leave them to but thorough daily care To get, and nightly feare to lose his owne, He led a wretched life, unto himselfe unknowne. Most wretched wight, whom nothing might suffise Whose greedy lust did lacke in greatest store Whose need had end, but no end covetise Whose welth was want, whose plenty made him pore Who had enough, yet wished ever more A vile disease and eke in foote and hand A grievous gout tormented him full sore, That well he could not touch, nor goe, nor stand. Such one was Avarice, the fourth of this faire band.
