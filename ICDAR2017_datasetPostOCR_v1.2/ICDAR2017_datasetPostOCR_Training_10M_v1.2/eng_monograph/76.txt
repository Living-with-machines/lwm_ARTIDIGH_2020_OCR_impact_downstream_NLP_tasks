[OCR_toInput] SECT. II. THE FAERY QUEENE - THE INTRODUCTION. 35 ' SECTION II. 1590-1600 . XXVI. THE FAERY QUEENE-THE INTRODUCTION. A gentle Knight was pricking on the plaine, Ycladd in mightie armes and silver shielde, Wherein old dints of deepe woundes did remaine, The cruell markes of many a bloody fielde Yet armes till that time did he never wield. His angry steede did chide his foming bitt, As much disdayning to the curbe to yield Full jolly knight he seemd, and faire did sitt, As one for knightly giusts and fierce encounters fitt. And on his brest a bloodie Crosse he bore, The deare remembrance of his dying Lord, For whose sweete sake that glorious badge he wore And dead, as living, ever him adored Upon his shield the like was also scored, For soveraine hope which in his helpe he had. Right faithfull true he was in deede and word, But of his cheere did seeme too solemne sad Yet nothing did he dread, but ever was ydrad. Upon a great adventure he was bond, That greatest Gloriana to him gave, That greatest Glorious Queene of Faery lond To winne him worshippe, and her grace to have, Which of all earthly things he most did crave And ever as he rode his hart did earne To prove his puissance in battell brave Upon his foe, and his new force to learne, Upon his foe, a Dragon horrible and stearne.
