[OCR_toInput] sBK. Ill 262 AN ENGLISH ANTHOLOGY. SECTION II. 1726-1744 . CCXVI. A SNOW SCENE The keener tempests come and fuming dun From all the livid east, or piercing north, Thick clouds ascend - in whose capacious womb A vapoury deluge lies, to snow congealed. Heavy they roll their fleecy world along And the sky saddens with the gathered storm. Through the hushed air the whitening shower descends At first thin wavering till at last the flakes Fall broad, and wide, and fast, dimming the day With a continual flow. The cherished fields Put on their winter robe of purest white. 'Tis brightness all, save where the new snow melts Along the mazy current. Low the woods Bow their hoar head and, ere the languid sun Faint from the west emits his evening ray, Earth's universal face, deep-hid and chill, Is one wild dazzling waste, that buries wide The works of man. Drooping the labourer-ox Stands covered o'er with snow, and then demands The fruit of all his toil. The fowls of heaven, Tamed by the cruel season, crowd around The winnowing store, and claim the little boon Which Providence assigns them. One alone, The redbreast, sacred to the household gods, Wisely regardful of the embroiling sky, In joyless fields and thorn ' thickets leaves His shivering mates, and pays to trusted man
