When fainting nature called for aid, And hovering death prepared the blow, His vigorous remedy displayed The power of art without the show. In misery's darkest cavern known, His useful care was ever nigh, Where hopeless anguish poured his groan, And lonely want retired to die. No summons, mocked by chill delay, No petty gain disdained by pride The modest wants of every day, The toil of even- day supplied. His virtues walked their narrow round, Nor made a pause, nor left a void And sure the Eternal Master found The single talent well employed. The busy day, the peaceful night, Unfelt, uncounted, glided by His frame was firm, his powers were bright, Though now his eightieth year was nigh. Then, with no fiery, throbbing pain, No cold gradations of decay, Death broke at once the vital chain, And freed his soul the nearest way. 1782. Johnson. • Do you remember the verses, the sacred verses, which Johnson wrote on the death of his humble friend Levet ? Whose name looks the brightest now, that of Queensbury the wealthy duke, or Selwyn the wit, or Levet the poor physician ? ' - Thackeray.
