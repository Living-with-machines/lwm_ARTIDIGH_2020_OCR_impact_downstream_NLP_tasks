But life did never to one man allow Time to discover worlds, and conquer too Nor can so short a line sufficient be To fathom the vast depths of Nature's sea The work he did we ought to admire, And were unjust if we should more require From his few years, divided 'twixt the excess Of low affliction and high happiness. For who on things remote can fix his sight, That's always in a triumph, or a fight ? - Cowley
