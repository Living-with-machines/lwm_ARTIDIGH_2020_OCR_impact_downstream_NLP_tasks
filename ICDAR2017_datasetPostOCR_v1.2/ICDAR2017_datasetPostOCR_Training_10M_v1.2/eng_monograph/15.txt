As for me, I'll be free, Love shall never conquer me, Pal, lal ral lal, sal ral la'. When I was young, when I was young, I found out man's deceitful tongue, They oft would flatter, hoax and coax, To gain my love by funny jokes, But I know still they'd have their will, And shake me off like easy gloves, Higgledy, piggledy, fie for shame, It is the female sex I blame, Who ought to know with all their loves, That men are hawks and we are doves. Do you think I'd marry, oh ! no, not I To have six brats to squall and cry, Six brats I am to have I know, The fortune teller told me so, And more than that, she told me flat, My husband then from me would fly Higgledy, piggledy, needles and pins, Matrimony and sorrow begins, A maid I'll live, and a maid I'll die, .

To the light horse I bid adieu, Which once was my delight, And then my journey I'll pursue, Aud travel in the night.
