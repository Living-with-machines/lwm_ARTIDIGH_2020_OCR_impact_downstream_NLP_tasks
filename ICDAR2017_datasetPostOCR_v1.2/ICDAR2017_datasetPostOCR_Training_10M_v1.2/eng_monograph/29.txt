THE 'WRECK OP THE BRAZEN SLOOP OF WAB, ¥0U seamen all I pray jnve attention, To these few lines I'm going to tell, A shocking story I'm going to tell you, Which the Brazen sloop befell. It was early on the Sunday morning, On January the twenty-sixth, On the high rocks near to Newhaven, The Brazen sloop so fast did stick. 'Twas when she struck it was at low water, Just at the turning of the tide, To tell the power of wind and water, No man was able to describe. How shocking for to hear the screaming, The crew for help SO loud did call, Her masts and rigging was broke asunder, Like chaff before the wind did fall. How shocking for to hear the screaming, The crew for mercy they loud did call, There was many on the shore stood gazing, But they could give no help at all. Captain Ancil and tho lieutenant, They strips and tried to swim on shore, But sad to say they were soon exhausted, Drowned they were and could swim no more. Now the captain he has left a widow, And four poor children for to weep, And four more on board with him, And they were drowned in the deep. This woman being heavy with child, Which made the matter still the worse The worthy man bad left a widow And four poor children fatherless. Some of the boats were broke to pieces, Their lives to save was all in vain, That shocking sight was quite heart-rending, To see them sink in the troubled main. How shocking for to hear the screaming, The crew for health so loud did roar, Pieces of timber - likewise dead bodies, From the Brazen sloop the water bore. Some with money, and some with watches, Gold rings around their fingers too, Some with wives and some with sweethearts, In sorrow did lament it's true. How shocking 'twas for to behold them, Struggling with the troubled wave, Out of one hundred and fifteen seamen, But one poor seaman from the wreck was saveO. Now to conclude and finish my ditty, A mournful tale throughout my song, May God protect all British seamen, That on the raging seas belong May bright angels guard the ocean, And safely seamen for to guide, °?A ft Not like the Brazen that was condemn d, # IF All on Newhaven's rocks to ride.
