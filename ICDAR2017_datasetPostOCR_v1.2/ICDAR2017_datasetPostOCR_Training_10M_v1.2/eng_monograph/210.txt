[OCR_toInput] •'• SECT TO A TREE. 249 When Ajax strives some rock's vast weight to throw, The line too labours and the words move slow Not so when swift Camilla scours the plain, Flies o'er the unbending corn and skims along the main. Hear how Timotheus' varied lays surprise, And bid alternate passions fall and rise ! While at each change, the son of Libyan Jove Now burns with glory, and then melts with love Now his fierce eyes with sparkling fury glow, Now sighs steal out, and tears begin to flow Persians and Greeks like turns of nature found, And the world's victor stood subdued by sound ! The power of music all our hearts allow, And what Timotheus was, is Dryden now. 171 1. - Pope. ccvn TO A TREE. Fair Tree ! for thy delightful shade 'Tis just that some return be made Sure some return is due from me To thy cool shadows and to thee. When thou to birds dost shelter give Thou music dost from them receive If travellers beneath thee stay Till storms have worn themselves away. That time in praising thee they spend, And thy protecting power commend The shepherd here, from scorching freed, Tunes to thy dancing leaves his reed, Whilst his loved nymph in thanks bestows Her flowery chaplets on thy boughs.
