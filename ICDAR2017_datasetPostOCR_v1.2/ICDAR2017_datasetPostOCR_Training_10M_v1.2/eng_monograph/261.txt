[OCR_toInput] BK. III. AN ENGLISH ANTHOLOGY. 320 CCXLIV. HYMN TO ADVERSITY. Daughter of Jove, relentless Power, Thou tamer of the human breast, Whose iron scourge and torturing hour The bad affright, afflict the best ! Bound in thy adamantine chain The proud are taught to taste of pain, And purple tyrants vainly groan With pangs unfelt before, unpitied and alone. When first thy sire to send on earth Virtue, his darling child, designed, To thee he gave the heavenly birth, And bade to form her infant mind. Stern rugged Nurse ! thy rigid lore With patience many a year she bore What sorrow was thou bad'st her know, And, from her own, she learned to melt at others' woe. Scared at thy frown terrific, fly Self-pleasing Folly's idle brood, Wild Laughter, Noise, and thoughtless Joy, And leave us leisure to be good. Light they disperse, and with them go The summer friend, the flattering foe By vain Prosperity received, To her they vow their truth, and are again believed. Wisdom, in sable garb arrayed, Immersed in rapturous thought profound, And Melancholy, silent maid With leaden eye, that loves the ground, In 1753 Dodsley published Designs by Mr. R. Bentlev for Six Poems by Mr. T. Gray. These were the Ode on the Spring and Ode on the Death of a Favourite Cat second edition , Eton Ode third edition , A Long Story and Hymn lo Adversity first edition , and the Elegy.
