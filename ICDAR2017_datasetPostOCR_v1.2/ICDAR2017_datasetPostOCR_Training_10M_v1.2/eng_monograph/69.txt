[OCR_toInput] SECT. I. SONNETS. 23 XIV. TO THE NIGHT. O Night, the ease of care, the pledge of pleasure, Desire's best mean, harvest of hearts affected, The seat of peace, the throne which is erected Of human life to be the quiet measure Be victor still of Phoebus' golden treasure, Who hath our sight with too much sight infected Whose light is cause we have our lives neglected, Turning all Nature's course to self displeasure. These stately stars in their now shining faces, With Sinless sleep, and Silence Wisdom's mother, Witness his wrong which by thy help is eased Thou art, therefore, of these our desert places The sure refuge by thee and by no other My soul is blest, sense joyed, and fortune raised. - Sidney. xv. THE NIGHTINGALE. t The nightingale, as soon as April bringeth Unto her rested sense a perfect waking, While late bare earth, proud of new clothing, springeth, Sings out her woes, a thorn her song-book making, And mournfully bewailing, Her throat in tunes expresseth What grief her breast oppresseth For Tereus' force on her chaste will prevailing. O Philomela fair, O take some gladness, That here is juster cause of plaintful sadness Thine earth now springs, mine fadeth Thy thorn without, my thorn my heart invadeth. Ib. In the Arcadia, first published 1590. In the Arcadia, ed. 1595.
