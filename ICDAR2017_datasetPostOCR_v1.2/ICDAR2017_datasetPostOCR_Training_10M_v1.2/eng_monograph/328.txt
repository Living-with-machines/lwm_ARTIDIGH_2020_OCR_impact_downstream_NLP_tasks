[OCR_toInput] BK. IV 442 AN ENGLISH ANTHOLOGY. Wolfe CCCXLIII. SONG. If I had thought thou could'st have died, I might not weep for thee But I forgot, when by thy side, That thou could'st mortal be. It never through my mind had past That time would e'er be o'er, And I on thee should look my last, And thou should'st smile no more ! And still upon that face I look, And think 'twill smile again And still the thought I will not brook That I must look in vain. But when I speak thou dost not say, What thou ne'er left'st unsaid And now I feel, as well I may, Sweet Mary, thou art dead ! If thou would'st stay, e'en as thou art, All cold, and all serene -I still might press thy silent heart, And where thy smiles have been ! While e'en thy chill, bleak corse I have Thou seemest still mine own But there - I lay thee in thy grave, And I am now alone ! I do not think, where'er thou art, Thou hast forgotten me And I, perhaps, may soothe this heart, In thinking still of thee Vet there was round thee such a dawn Of light ne'er seen before, As fancy never could have drawn, And never can restore !
