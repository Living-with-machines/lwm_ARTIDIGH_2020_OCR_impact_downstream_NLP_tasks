[OCR_toInput] 396 bk AN ENGLISH ANTHOLOGY. IV. CCCVI. ELEGIAC STANZAS, SUGGESTED BY A PICTURE OF PEELE CASTLE IN A STORM PAINTED BY SIR GEORGE BEAUMONT. I was thy neighbour once, thou rugged Pile ! Four summer weeks I dwelt in sight of thee I saw thee every day and all the while Thy form was sleeping on a glassy sea. So pure the sky, so quiet was the air ! So like, so very like, was day to day ! Whene'er I looked, thy image still was there It trembled, but it never passed away. How perfect was the calm ! It seemed no sleep, No mood, which season takes away, or brings I could have fancied that the mighty Deep Was even the gentlest of all gentle things. Ah ! then if mine had been the painter's hand To express what then I saw and add the gleam, The light that nev.-r was on sea or land, The consecration, and the Poet's dream I would have planted thee, thou hoary pile, Amid a world how different from this ! Beside a ea that could not cease to smile On tranquil land, beneath a sky of bliss. A picture had it been of lasting ease, Elysian quiet, without toil or strife No motion but the moving tide, a breeze, Or merely silent Nature's breathing life. Such, in the fond illusion of my heart, Such picture would I at that time have made And seen the soul of truth in every part, A steadfast peace that might not be betrayed.
