[OCR_toInput] SECT. I. J AMONG MY BOOKS. 44I 441 AMONG MY BOOKS. My days among the dead are past Around me I behold, Where'er these casual eyes are cast, The mighty minds of old My never-failing friends are they, With whom I converse day by day. With them I take delight in weal, And seek relief in woe And while I understand and feel How much to them I owe, My cheeks have often been bedewed With tears of thoughtful gratitude. My thoughts are with the dead with them I live in long-past years, Their virtues love, their faults condemn, Partake their hopes and fears, And from their lessons seek and find Instruction with an humble mind. My hopes are with the dead anon My place with them will be, And I with them shall travel on, Through all futurity Yet leaving here a name, I trust, That will not perish in the dust. - Southey. See a passage from Southey's Colloquies, quoted by Professor Dowden in his Southey, pp. 106 to 109. Southey writes ' My library, if reduced to twelve books, would consist of Shakspere, Chaucer, Spenser and Milton Jackson, Jeremy Taylor and South Izaak Walton, Sidney's Arcadia, Fuller's Church History and Sir Thomas Browne '.
