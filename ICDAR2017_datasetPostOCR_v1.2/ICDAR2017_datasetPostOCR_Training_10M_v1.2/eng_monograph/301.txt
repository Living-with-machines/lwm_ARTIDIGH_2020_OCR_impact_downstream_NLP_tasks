[OCR_toInput] SECT. I. 387 SONNETS. CCXCVI. IN LONDON, 1802. O Friend, I know not which way I must look For comfort, being, as I am, oppress To think that now our life is only drest For show mean handiwork of craftsman, cook, Or groom ! - We must run glittering like a brook In the open sunshine, or we are unblest The wealthiest man among us is the best No grandeur now in Nature or in book Delights us. Rapine, avarice, expense, This is idolatry and these we adore Plain living and high thinking are no more The homely beauty of the good old cause Is gone our peace, our faithful innocence, And pure religion breathing household laws. - Wordsworth. ccxcvn. COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE SEPTEMBER 3, 1802. Earth has not any thing to show more fair Dull would he be of soul who could pass by A sight so touching in its majesty This city now doth like a garment wear The beauty of the morning silent, bare, Ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie Open unto the fields and to the sky, All bright and glittering in the smokeless air. Never did sun more beautifully steep In his first splendour valley, rock, or hill Ne'er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep ! The river glideth at his own sweet will Dear God ! the very houses seem asleep And all that mighty heart is lying still ! - Ib
