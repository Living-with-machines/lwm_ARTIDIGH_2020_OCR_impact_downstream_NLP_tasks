[OCR_toInput] SECT. I. LIFE. 415 cccxvi. LIFE. Life ! I know not what thou art, But know that thou and I must part And when, or how, or where we met I own to me's a secret yet. But this I know, when thou art fled, Where'er they lay these limbs, this head, No clod so valueless shall be As all that then remains of me. Oh whither, whither dost thou fly, Where bend unseen thy trackless course, And in this strange divorce, Ah, tell where I must seek this compound I ? To the vast ocean of empyreal flame From whence thy essence came Dost thou thy flight pursue, when freed From matter's base encumbering weed ? Or dost thou, hid from sight, Wait, like some spell-bound knight, Through blank oblivious years the appointed hour To break thy trance and re-assume thy power ? Yet can'st thou without thought or feeling be ? Oh say what art thou when no more thou'rt thee ? Life ! we've been long together Through pleasant and through cloudy weather 'Tis hard to part when friends are dear, -Perhaps 'twill cost a sigh, a tear ' Sitting with Madame D'Arblay, some weeks before she died 1840 , I said to her, Do you remember those lines the first four and the last eight of Mrs. Barbauld's Life, which I once repeated to you ? Remember them ! she replied, I repeat them to my self every night before I go to sleep. ' - Rogers.
