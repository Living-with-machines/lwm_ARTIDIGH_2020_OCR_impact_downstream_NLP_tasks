[OCR_toInput] BK. IV AN ENGLISH ANTHOLOGY. 414 And sweetly to each other smile The livelong day - sun, cloud, and isle. How silent lies each sheltered bay ! No other visitors have they To their shores of silvery sand, Than the waves that murmuring in their glee, All hurrying in a joyful band, Come dancing from the sea. - Wilson cccxv. LOVE'S IMMORTALITY. They sin who tell us Love can die ! With life all other passions fly All others are but vanity. In heaven ambition cannot dwell, Nor avarice in the vaults of hell Earthly, these passions are of earth, They perish where they have their birth. But Love is indestructible Its holy flame for ever burneth, From heaven it came, to heaven returneth Too oft on earth a troubled guest, At times deceived, at times oppressed, It here is tried and purified, And hath in heaven its perfect rest. It soweth here with toil and care, But the harvest-time of Love is there. Oh ! when a mother meets on high The babe she lost in infancy, Hath she not then, for pains and fears, The day of woe, the anxious night, For all her sorrows, all her tears, An over-payment of delight? 1810. - Southcy, The Curse of Kehama
