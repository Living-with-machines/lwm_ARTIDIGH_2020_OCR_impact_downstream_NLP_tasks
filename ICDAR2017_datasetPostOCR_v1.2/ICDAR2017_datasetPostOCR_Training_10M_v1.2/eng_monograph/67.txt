[OCR_toInput] SECT. I. NO AGE CONTENT WITH HIS OWN ESTATE. 19 The young man eke, that feels his bones with pains oppressed, How he would be a rich old man, to live and lie at rest. The rich old man, that sees his end draw on so sore, How he would be a boy again, to live so much the more. Whereat full oft I smiled, to see how all these three, From boy to man, from man to boy, would chop and change degree. And, musing thus, I think the case is very strange, That man from wealth, to live in woe, doth ever seek to change. Thus thoughtful as I lay, I saw my withered skin, How it doth show my dented chews, the flesh was worn so thin. And eke my toothless chaps, the gates of my right way, That opes and shuts as I do speak, do thus unto me say 'Thy white and hoarish hairs, the messengers of age, That show, like lines of true belief, that this life doth assuage, Bid thee lay hand and feel them hanging on thy chin. The which doth write two ages past, the third now coming in. Hang up therefore the bit of thy young wanton time And thou, that therein beaten art, the happiest life define.' Whereat I sighed, and said ' Farewell, my wonted joy, Truss up thy pack and trudge from me, to every little boy, And tell them thus from me, their time most happy is, If, to their time, they reason had to know the truth of this '. - Surrey.
