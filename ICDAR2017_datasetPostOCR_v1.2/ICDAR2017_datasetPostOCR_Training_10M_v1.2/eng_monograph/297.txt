[OCR_toInput] SECT. I. FABLE IS LOVE'S WORLD. 381 CCLXXXVII. FABLE IS LOVE'S WORLD. Max. O never rudely will I blame his faith In the might of stars and angels ! 'Tis not merely The human being's pride that peoples space With life and mystical predominance Since likewise for the stricken heart of Love This visible nature, and this common world, Is all too narrow yea, a deeper import Lurks in the legend told my infant years Than lies upon that truth, we live to learn For fable is Love's world, his home, his birthplace Delightedly dwells he 'mong fays and talismans, And spirits and delightedly believes Divinities, being himself divine. The intelligible forms of ancient poets, The fair humanities of old religion, The power, the beauty, and the majesty, That had their haunts in dale, or piny mountain, Or forest, by slow stream, or pebbly spring, Or chasms and watery depths all these have vanished They live no longer in the faith of reason ! But still the heart doth need a language, still Doth the old instinct bring back the old names, And to yon starry world they now are gone, Spirits or gods, that used to share this earth With man as with their friend and to the lover This and the next are from Coleridge's translation of Schiller's Piccolomini, or the First Part of Wallenstcin. Lines 14 to 20 are an expansion of two in the original which literally translated are -' The old fable existences are no more, The fascinating race has wandered away '. J The passage from lines ro to 20 is quoted in Scott's Guy Manncring, 1S15.
