[OCR_toInput] SECT. III. SPEECH OF ULYSSES. 95 LXXIX. SPEECH OF ULYSSES. Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back, Wherein he puts alms for oblivion, A great-sized monster of ingratitudes Those scraps are good deeds past which are devoured As fast as they are made, forgot as soon As done perseverance, dear my lord, Keeps honour bright to have done is to hang Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail In monumental mockery. Take the instant way For honour travels in a strait so narrow, Where one but goes abreast keep then the path For emulation hath a thousand sons, That one by one pursue if you give way, Or hedge aside from the direct forthright, Like to an entered tide, they all rush by, And leave you hindmost -Or, like a gallant horse fallen in first rank, Lie there for pavement to the abject rear, O'er-run and trampled on then what they do in present, Though less than yours in past, must o'ertop yours For time is like a fashionable host, That slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand And with his arms outstretched as he would fly, Grasps-in the comer Welcome ever smiles, And Farewell goes out sighing. O let not virtue seek Remuneration for the thing it was For beauty, wit, High birth, vigour of bone, desert in service, Love, friendship, charity, are subjects all To envious and calumniating time.
