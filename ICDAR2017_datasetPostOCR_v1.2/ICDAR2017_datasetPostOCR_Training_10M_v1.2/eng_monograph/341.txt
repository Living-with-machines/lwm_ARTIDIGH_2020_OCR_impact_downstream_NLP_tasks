[OCR_toInput] SECT. II. NIGHT AND DEATH. 475 Both Love and Hope beneath the load give way Then with a statue's smile, a statue's strength, Stands the mute sister, Patience, nothing loth, And both supporting does the work of both. 1827. - Coleridge. CCCLXX. NIGHT AND DEATH. Mysterious Night ! when our first parent knew Thee from report divine, and heard thy name, Did he not tremble for this lovely frame, This glorious canopy of light and blue ? Yet 'neath a curtain of translucent dew, Bathed in the rays of the great setting flame, Hesperus, with the host of heaven came And lo ! creation widened in man's view. Who could have thought such darkness lay concealed Within thy beams, O Sun ? or who could find, Whilst fly, and leaf, and insect stood revealed, That to such countless orbs thou madest us blind ? Why do we then shun Death with anxious strife ? -If Light can thus deceive, wherefore not Life ?t - Blanco White. Published in the Bijou Pickering , 1828. f ' The finest and most grandly-conceived sonnet in our language at least it is only in Milton and Wordsworth that I remember any rival. ' - Coleridge. 'The exquisite art of this sonnet of Mr. Blanco White's seems to us to exhibit, as in a perfect type, the true rationale of the sonnet. It is not abstract, for it is penetrated throughout with the most vivid sense of vision it is not merely or chiefly pictorial, for its whole life and meaning are intellectual, an appeal to the highest and subtlest kind of analogy it is not didactic, for it throbs with the keenest of human feelings, the profound mystery of Death mingled with the instinct of immortality it is not stagnant - the worst danger of the sonnet - but full of motion, every line advancing you towards the conclusion . . . and it contrives, as but few sonnets do, to combine the vivid flash of a surprise with the stately movement of an intellectual train of thought.' - The Spectator, Dec. 20, 1873.
