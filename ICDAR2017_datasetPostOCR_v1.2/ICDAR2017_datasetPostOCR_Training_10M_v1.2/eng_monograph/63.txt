[OCR_toInput] SECT. I. FROM PATIENT GRISSEL. 11 For which here, for the wives love of Bathe, Whos lif and al hire secte God maintene In high maistrie, and elles were it scathe, I wol with lusty herte fresshe and grene, Say you a song to gladen you, I wene And let us stint of ernestful matere. Herkneth my song, that saith in this manere. Grisilde is ded, and eke hire patience, And both at ones buried in Itaille For which I crie in open audience, No wedded man so hardly be to assaille His wives patience, in trust to find Grisildes, for in certain he shal faille. O noble wives, ful of high prudence, Let non humilitee your tonges naile Ne let no clerk have cause or diligence To write of you a storie of swiche mervaille, As of Grisildis patient and kinde, Lest Chichevache you swalwe in hire entraille Folweth ecco, that holdeth no silence, But ever answereth at the countretaille Beth not bedaffed for your innocence, But sharply taketh on you the governaille Emprenteth wel this lesson in your minde, For comun profit, sith it may availle. Ye archewives, stondeth ay at defence, Sin ye be strong, as is a gret camaille, Ne suffreth not, that men do you offence. And sclendre wives, feble as in bataille, Beth egre as is a tigre yond in Inde Ay clappeth as a mill, I you counsaille.
