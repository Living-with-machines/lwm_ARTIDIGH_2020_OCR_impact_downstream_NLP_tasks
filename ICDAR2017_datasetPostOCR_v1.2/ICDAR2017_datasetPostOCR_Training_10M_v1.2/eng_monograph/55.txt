[OCR_toInput] THE ONE HORSE CHAY, MBS. Bubb was gay and free, fair and fat, and forty-three, And blooming as a peony in buxom May, The toast she long had been of Farringdon Within, And tilled the better half of the one horse chay.'

So let us have a trip to Brighton in the one horse Mr. Bubb said to his wife, now I think upon't my life, 'Tis three weeks at least to next boiling day, The dog days are set in and London's growing thin, So I'll order out Old Nobbs and the one horse chay. Now Nobbs it must be told, was rather fat and old, Its colour was white, and it had been gray He was round as a scot, and when soundly whipt would trot, Full five miles an hour in a one horse chay. When at Brighton they were housed, and had stuffed and caroused, Over a bowl of rack punch, Mr. Bubb did say, -I've ascertained my dear the mode of dipping here, From the ostler who is clearing up the one horse chay. SHE IS FAR FMTHEIAND London - H. SUCH, Printer and Publisher, 177, Union Street, Borough. - S.E. SHE is far fromtheland,whereher young hero sleeps, And lovers are round her sighing But coldly she turns from their gaze and weeps, For her heart in his grave is lying ! She sings the wild song of her dear native plains, Every note which he loved awaking -Oh ! little they think, who delight in her strains, How the heart of the minstrel is breaking ! He had lived for his love, for his country he died, They were all that to life had entwined him, -Nor soon shall the tears of his country be dried. Nor long will his love stay behind him. Oh ! make her a grave where the sunbeams rest, When they promise a glorious morrow They'll shineo'er her sleep, like a smile from the West, From her own loved island of sorrow. You're shut up in a box, ill convenient as the stocks And eigh teen-pence each time are obliged for to pay. Court corruption here say I, makes everything so high, And I wish I had come without my one horse chay. And as I hope, says she to thrive, 'tis frying folks alive, The King and their extortioners are leagued I say, 'Tis encouraging of such, to go and pay so much, So we'll set them at defiance with our one horse chay Old Nobbs, I'm sartin, may be trusted gig or cart in, He takes every matter in an easy way, He'll stand like a post while we dabble on the coast, And return back to dress in our one horse chay. So out they drove all drest, so gaily in their best, And finding in their rambles a snug little bay, They undress'd at their leisure, paddled out at their pleasure, And left every-thing behind in their one horse chay. But while so snugly sure, that all things Were secure They flounced about like porpoises or whales at play. Some young unlucky imps, who prowled about for shrimps, Stole up to reconnoitre the one horse chay. Old Nobbs in quiet mood was sleeping as he stood, He might possibly be dreaming of his corn or hay, Not a foot did he wag, as they whipt out every rag, And gutted the contents of the one horse chay. When our pair was soused enough, and returning in their buff Oh, there was the veugeance and old Nick to pay, Madam shrieked in cousternation, Mr. Bubb he swore damnation, To find tbe empty state of the one horse chay.
