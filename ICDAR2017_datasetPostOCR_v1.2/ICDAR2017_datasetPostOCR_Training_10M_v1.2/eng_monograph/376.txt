[OCR_toInput] ST. CHRISTOPHER. 43 A number of passengers, of whom I was one, were ferried ashore about seven o'clock. We landed in safety on a well-built pier project ing a hundred feet or more from the beach, on which the waves were tumbling within a few yards of the front walls of a row of stores and warehouses, built in a curve along the shore. Immediately upon set ting foot on land we were surrounded by a host of fruit aud flower sellers, and those having cocoanuts and sugar-cane for sale all of them, singly and collectively, and no less noisily than their brethren in the boats which had followed us landward from the ship, clamored for our patronage, thrusting their wares into our faces - indeed, I may say, with much color of truth, almost into our mouths. Being abun dantly supplied, by reason of purchases made aforetime on board ship, we politely but firmly refused all the bargains which were offered with exasperating persistence not to say maddening reiteration, walked up the wharf, passed through a picturesque and ancient gate-way, ran the gauntlet of Her Majesty's customs-officers, and at last found ourselves in the metropolis of St. Christopher.
