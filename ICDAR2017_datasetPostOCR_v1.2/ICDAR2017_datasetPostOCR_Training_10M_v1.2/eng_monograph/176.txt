[OCR_toInput] SECT. II. DEATH S FINAL CONQUEST. 197 Only the future's thine, the present his ! 'shine's the more hard and noble bliss Best apprehender of our joys, which hast So long a reach, and yet canst hold so fast ! Hope, thou sad lover's only friend ! Thou way, that mayst dispute it with the end For love I fear's a fruit that does delight The taste itself less than the smell and sight. I Fruition more deceitful is Than thou canst be when thou dost miss Men leave thee by obtaining, and straight flee Some other way again to thee And that's a pleasant country, without doubt, To which all soon return that travel out. Cowley. CLXVI. DEATH'S FINAL CONQUEST. The glories of our blood and state Are shadows, not substantial things There is no armour against fate Death lays his icy hand on kings Sceptre and crown Must tumble down, And in the dust be equal made With the poor crooked scythe and spade. Some men with swords may reap the field, And plant fresh laurels where they kill But their strong nerves at last must yield, They tame but one another still Early or late, They stoop to fate, From The Contention of Aj ax and Ulysses, a Masque. 1659. ' The fine song which old Bowman used to sing to King Charles and which he often sung to me.' - Oldys.
