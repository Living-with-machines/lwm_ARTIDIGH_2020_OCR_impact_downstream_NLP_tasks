In my former days of bliss, Her divine skill taught me this, That from everything I saw, I could some invention draw, And raise pleasure to her height Through the meanest object's sight By the murmur of a spring, Or the least bough's rustling, By a daisy whose leaves spread Shut when Titan goes to bed, Or a shady bush or tree, She could more infuse in me Than all Nature's beauties can In some other wiser man. By her help I also now Make this churlish place allow Some things that may sweeten gladness In the very gall of sadness. The dull loneness, the black shade That these hanging vaults have made, The strange music of the waves Beating on these hollow caves, This black den which rocks emboss, Overgrown with eldest moss, The rude portals that give light More to terror than delight, This my chamber of neglect Walled about with disrespect, From all these and this dull air, A fit object for despair, She hath taught me, by her might, To draw comfort and delight.
