[OCR_toInput] 218 AN ENGLISH ANTHOLOGY. BK. II His fancy and his judgment such, Each to the other seemed too much His severe judgment, giving law, His modest fancy kept in awe, As rigid husbands jealous are When they believe their wives too fair. His English stream so pure did flow, As all that saw and tasted know. - Deuham CLXXX. THE DANGER OF RICHES AND POWER. Extol not riches, then, the toil of fools, The wise man's cumbrance, if not snare more apt To slacken Virtue and abate her edge Than prompt her to do aught may merit praise What if with like aversion I reject Riches and realms ? Yet not for that a crown, Golden in show, is but a wreath of thorns. Brings dangers, troubles, cares, and sleepless nights, To him who wears the regal diadem, When on his shoulders each man's burden lies For therein stands the office of a king, His honour, virtue, merit, and chief praise. That for the public all this weight he bears. Yet he who reigns within himself, and rules, Passions, desires, and fears, is more a king, Which every wise and virtuous man attains And who attains not ill aspires to rule Cities of men, or headstrong multitudes, Subject himself to anarchy within. Or lawless passions in him, which he serves. But to guide nations in the way of truth By saving doctrine, and from error lead To know, and, knowing, worship God aright.
