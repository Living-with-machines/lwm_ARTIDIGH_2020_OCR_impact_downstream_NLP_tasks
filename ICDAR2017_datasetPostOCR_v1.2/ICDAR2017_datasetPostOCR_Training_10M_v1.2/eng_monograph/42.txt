You have heard talk of Colin Kiln, when his prophecy begun, As he traced it to the last generation, I'm sure you'll find it true, for the tax that's laid anew Has sorely oppressed our Irish nation. Since the poor laws did take place, you did shortly want no lease, You disown both your cattle and your country, From your farms you run away, as your rent you can-not pay, Since the uuion have ruined our nation.

God bless St. Peter's rock, where Christ has fed his flock, They have treated it with the greatest of slander, They swore our church was not pure, and opened ano-ther door, And our parliament they brought it to London. The tories stay at home to oppress the church of Bome And to keep us pooi-Catholics under, They must all return home to England very soon, For Ireland won't keep them any longer. After uew year's day this heavy tax you pay, To keep the poor-house in good order, I'm sure you find it strange to provide the change, When tie landlord he caroe on Monday morning Be quick, look to your ground as the rent cannot be found, Go and call your noblemen from London, Or you must work like slaves till you go to your graves Unless from tl e union you return. Now I'll end my song as my verses are not long, I hope 1 have told you of no treason, That the orange may fall, so with the tories all, That have sorely oppressed our Irish nation. The Pope long may he reign, and the Cardinals the Dan O'Conneli was the pride of our nation, same, Our chapel is in full bloom until the day of doom, To vex t iose rotten members while they're weeping.
