How oft do they their silver bowers leave, To come to succour us that succour want ! How oft do they with golden pinions cleave The flitting skies, like flying pursuivant, Against fowle feendes to ayd us militant They for us fight, they watch and dewly ward, And their bright squadrons round about us plant And all for love, and nothing for reward. O ! why should hevenly God to men have such regard ? -Ib., ii. 8.
