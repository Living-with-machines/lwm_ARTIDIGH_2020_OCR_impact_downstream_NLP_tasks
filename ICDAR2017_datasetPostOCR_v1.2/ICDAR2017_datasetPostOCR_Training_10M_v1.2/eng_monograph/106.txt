[OCR_toInput] BK. I. y AN ENGLISH ANTHOLOGY. 78 THE TREASURES OF THE ENGLISH TONGUE.'' Power above powers ! O heavenly Eloquence ! That, with the strong rein of commanding words, Dost manage, guide, and master the eminence Of men's affections more than all their swords Shall we not offer to thy excellent The richest treasure that our wit affords ? Thou that canst do much more with one poor pen Than all the powers of princes can effect, And draw, divert, dispose, and fashion men Better than force or rigour can direct Should we this ornament of glory then, As the immaterial fruits of shades, neglect ? Or, should we, careless, come behind the rest In power of words, that go before in worth ? When as our accent, equal to the best, Is able greater wonders to bring forth When all that ever hotter spirits expressed Comes bettered by the patience of the north. And who, in time, knows whither we may vent The treasure of our tongue to what strange shores This gain of our best glory shall be sent To enrich unknowing nations with our stores What worlds in the yet unformed Occident May come refined with th' accents that are ours ? Or, who can tell for what great work in hand The greatness of our style is now ordained ? What powers it shall bring in, what spirits command, What thoughts let out, what humours keep restrained, What mischiefs it may powerfully withstand, And what fair ends may thereby be attained ? From Daniel's Musophilus, containing a general Defence of Learning, 1599. ' The best poem of its kind in the language,' says Mr. Lowell. What a double fulfilment of lines 19-24 is this praise coming from a critic in the Occident !
