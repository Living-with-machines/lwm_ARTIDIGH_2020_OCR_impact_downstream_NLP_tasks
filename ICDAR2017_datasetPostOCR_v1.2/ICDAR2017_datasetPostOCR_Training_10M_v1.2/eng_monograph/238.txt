Her cap far whiter than the driven snow, Emblem right meet of decency does yield Her apron dyed in grain, as blue, I trow, As is the hare-bell that adorns the field, And in her hand, for sceptre, she does wield Tway birchen sprays with anxious fear entwined, With dark distrust, and sad repentance filled And stedfast hate, and sharp affliction joined, And fury uncontrolled, and chastisement unkind. . In elbow chair like that of Scottish stem, By the sharp tooth of cankering eld defaced, In which, when he receives his diadem. Our sovereign prince and liefest liege is placed, The matron sate and some with rank she graced, The source of children's and of courtier's pride! Redressed affronts, for vile affronts there passed And warned them not the fretful to deride, But love each other dear, whatever them betide. Right well she knew each temper to descry To thwart the proud, and the submiss to raise Some with vile copper-prize exalt on high, And some entice with pittance small of praise And other some with baleful sprig she 'frays, Ev'n absent, she the reins of power doth hold, While with quaint arts the giddy crowd she sways Forewarned, if little bird their pranks behold, swill whisper in her ear, and all the scene unfold. Low now with state she utters the command ! Eftsoons the urchins to their tasks repair Their books of stature small they take in hand,
