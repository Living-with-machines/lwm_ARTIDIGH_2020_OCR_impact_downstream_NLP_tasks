[OCR_toInput] SECT. II. TO THE COUNTESS OF CUMBERLAND. 55 Nor is he moved with all the thunder cracks Of tyrants' threats, or with the surly brow Of Power, that proudly sits on others' crimes, Charged with more crying sins than those he checks. The storms of sad confusion, that may grow Up in the present for the coming times, Appal not him, that hath no side at all But of himself, and knows the worst can fall. And whilst distraught ambition compasses, And is encompassed whilst as craft deceives, And is deceived whilst man doth ransack man, And builds on blood, and rises by distress And the inheritance of desolation leaves To great-expecting hopes he looks thereon As from the shore of peace, with unwet eye, And bears no venture in impiety. Which makes, that whatsoever here befals, You in the region of yourself remain Where no vain breath of the impudent molests, That hath secured within the brazen walls Of a clear conscience, that without all stain Rises in peace, in innocency rests Whilst all that malice from without procures, Shows her own ugly heart, but hurts not yours. And whereas none rejoice more in revenge, Than women use to do yet you well know That wrong is better checked by being contemned Than being pursued leaving to him to avenge, To whom it appertains. Wherein you show How worthily your clearness hath condemned Base Malediction, living in the dark, That at the rays of goodness still doth bark.
