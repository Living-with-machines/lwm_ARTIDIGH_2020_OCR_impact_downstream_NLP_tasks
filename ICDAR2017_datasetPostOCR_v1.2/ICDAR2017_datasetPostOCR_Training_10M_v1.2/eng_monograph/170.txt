[OCR_toInput] SECT. II. SONNETS BY MILTON. 187 CLVI. ON HIS BLINDNESS. When I consider how my life is spent Ere half my days in this dark world and wide, And that one talent which is death to hide Lodged with me useless, though my soul more bent To serve therewith my Maker, and present My true account, lest He, returning, chide ' Doth God exact day-labour, light denied ? ' I fondly ask. But Patience, to prevent That murmur, soon replies ' God doth not need Either man's work, or his own gifts. Who best Bear His mild yoke, they serve Him best. His state Is kingly thousands at His bidding speed, And post o'er land and ocean without rest They also serve who only stand and wait.' - Milton, Sonnet ig. CLVII. TO MR. LAWRENCE. Lawrence, of virtuous father virtuous son, Now that the fields are dank, and ways are mire. Where shall we sometimes meet, and by the fire Help waste a sullen day, what may be won From the hard season gaining ? Time will run On smoother, till Favonius re-inspire The frozen earth, and clothe in fresh attire The lily and rose, that neither sowed nor spun. What neat repast shall feast us, light and choice, Of Attic taste, with wine, whence we may rise To hear the lute well touched, or artful voice Warble immortal notes and Tuscan air ? He who of those delights can judge, and spare To interpose them oft, is not unwise. - Ib. 20. Son of Henry Lawrence, President of Cromwell's Council the family resided near Horton, where Milton lived after leaving Cam bridge.
