IN London once, as I've heard say, A maiden dwelt, named Carrier, Whose heart was beating night and day, For some-one who would marry her. Tho' sweethearts she'd had two or three, They each had got offended Because she would not decent be, And keep her stockings mended. CHORUS. Oh, such a fuss they made, Oh dear, you'll say 'tis shocking, There's none would have this charming maid, Because a hole was in her stocking. A barber first a wooing came, To her his love to thrust in Who said his heart was in a flame, So full that it was bursting. He said, while kneeling at her feet, Indeed I'm not a mocking, But as he viewed her face so sweet, He did not twig her stocking. Next day on him she gave a call, Her hair for to have platted, He could not comb it straight at all, Because it was so matted The barber at it cried, oh, fie ! And called her names most shocking, And as she put her foot so high, He saw a large hole in her stocking. A grocer next, quite full of puff, That came one day to court her, And said that he had gold enough Through life for to support her. She to his house so sly did creep, And at the door was knocking, The grocer up the airy peep'd, And then he spied her - stocking. A cobler next, said quite polite, - -y -In spite of wind and weather, Li I He'd always stick to her as tight vTfc As sole and upper leather She ordered shoes, which soon were done, For her sweet feet to rock in, But as she stoop'd to try them on, His eye fixed on her- stocking. So maidens all pray list to me, Before my song is ended, That if you'd wish to married be, Pray keep your stockings mended. This short advice- indeed 'tis true, Youll say perhaps I'm a bold one If you can't get cash to buy them new, Sit down and mend your old ones.
