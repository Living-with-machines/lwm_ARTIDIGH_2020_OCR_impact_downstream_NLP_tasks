[OCR_toInput] SECT. I. SCORN NOT THE SONNET. 469 CCCLXIII. WORK WITHOUT HOPE. All Nature seems at work. Slugs leave their lair -The bees are stirring - birds are on the wing -And Winter, slumbering in the open air, Wears on his smiling face a dream of Spring ! And I, the while, the sole unbusy thing, Nor honey make, nor pair, nor build, nor sing. Yet well I ken the banks where amaranths blow, Have traced the fount whence streams of nectar flow. Bloom, O ye amaranths ! bloom for whom ye may, For me ye bloom not ! Glide, rich streams, away ! With lips unbrightened, wreathless brow, I stroll And would you learn the spells that drowse my soul ? Work without hope draws nectar in a sieve, And hope without an object cannot live. - Coleridge. CCCLXIV. SCORN NOT THE SONNET Scorn not the Sonnet, Critic you have frowned, Mindless of its just honours with this key Shakespeare unlocked his heart the melody Of this small lute gave ease to Petrarch's wound A thousand times this pipe did Tasso sound With it Camoens soothed an exile's grief The Sonnet glittered a gay myrtle leaf Amid the cypress with which Dante crowned His visionary brow a glow-worm lamp, It cheered mild Spenser, called from Faery-land To struggle through dark ways and, when a damp Fell round the path of Milton, in his hand The Thing became a trumpet, whence he blew Soul-animating strains, - alas, too few ! - Wordsworth.
