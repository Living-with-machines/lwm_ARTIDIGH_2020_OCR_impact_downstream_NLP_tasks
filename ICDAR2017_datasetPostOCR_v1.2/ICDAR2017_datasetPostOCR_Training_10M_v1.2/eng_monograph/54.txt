Between two well known clergymen the other This left off branch it belonged to Luther He asked the other how his creed was wrong He says I'm scoffed at by its vile intruders, So between them both the argument went on. So now, dear friend, I could wish you to tell me, How there is salvation there to be found, In no other church but the Roman Temple, Was I to search the wide world round. Did not our Lord say to his disciples, My peace to all of you I'll leave, Go preach the gospel and teach all nations, That men of all sects they may be saved. Kind sir, to answer that simple question, For your conversion I will make bold Our blessed Lord his disciples ordered, To bring all stray sheep into his fold. The eares of his church he also gave to Peter, To reign triumphant as the scripture tells, And said at all times he would be with her, To defend and guard her from the powers of hell. So my dear friend the scriptures tell us, That Anamagus shall not be adored, Which you in worship do daily practice, ' 5AP78-If you contract me I'll say no more • r Besides, each Sunday at divine service -It's from the parson these words were told -That our religion it was the same As the Apostles told us in the days of old. Kind sir, to say that we worship images, It is a falsehood believe me true We only have them within our chapels, To remind us what we for the Lord should do. That we may also take pattern by them, For they were pure, and without spot or stain The imps of Satan, we do defy them, For by this maxim we shall salvation gain. Kind sir, moreover we did discover, That your parsons daily do so explore, That your religion it was the same As the Apostles in the days of yore. But where was your church before Martin Luther Or the Reformation had first began ? It was Bess, and Neddy, and old Harry Tudor, For lust invented that wicked plan. Now friend there is still another objection I have to make to the Roman creed, That is the doctrine you call it Confession, By which the Catholic from sin is freed. I don't believe that the Almighty Ever gave the power to any man, Of forgiving sins by confessing truly, As faith alone is our only plan. Kind sir, that question is easily answered, If you will peruse the 6th chapter of James, Where our blessed Lord his disciples ordered To confess their sins, the truth is very plain. When the keys to Peter and his priest were given, To lock and unlock the gates of heaven, Those sins you shall release, they are set free, And those sins you shall retain, retained shall be. So my dear friend, how can you say it's a libel, Saying we have not got no rule of faith, Wherein you knowr we have got the bible, By which we are guided both early and late. Will it not lead a man unto salvation, As it's surely God's written word, For to confute me in this dictation, I'm sure you cannot be so absurd. Kind sir, how can you say you have a bible, To be your regular rule of faith, When you know well it is so corrupted, From the reformation to the present date. First by King Harry it was invented, And by Martin Luther, and old Cranmer too So by this you are well confuted, As a correct copy you have none it's true. Now friend, I find that all your objections, Unto my questions are very true, Besides, your holy faith it is a perfect one, So while I live I'll it pursue. I see it plainly and very clearly, There is but one Lord, one faith, and one I own, So wish heartfelt joy to embrace it clearly, I will live and die in the Church of Rome. ®M nils I a H
