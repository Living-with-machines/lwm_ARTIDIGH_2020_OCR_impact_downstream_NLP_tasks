[OCR_toInput] SECT. I. THE DEATH OF FAUSTUS. 31 This soul should fly from me, and I be changed Into some brutish beast.

The devils whom Faustus served have torn him thus For 'twixt the hours of twelve and one, methought, I heard him shriek and call aloud for help At which self time the house seemed all on fire With dreadful horror of these damned fiends.
