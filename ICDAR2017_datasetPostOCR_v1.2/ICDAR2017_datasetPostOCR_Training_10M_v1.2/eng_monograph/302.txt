[OCR_toInput] SECT. I. TO AN EARLY PRIMROSE. 395 The Chief, whose antique crownlet long Still sparkled in the feudal song, Now, from the mountain's misty throne, Sees, in the thanedom once his own, His ashes undistinguished lie, His place, his power, his memory die His groans the lonely caverns fill, His tears of rage impel the rill All mourn the Minstrel's harp unstrung, Their name unknown, their praise unsung. - The Lay of the Last Minstrel, canto v. cccv. TO AN EARLY PRIMROSE. Mild offspring of a dark and sullen sire ! Whose modest form, so delicately fine, Was nursed in whirling storms, And cradled in the winds. Thee, when young Spring first questioned Winter's sway, And dared the sturdy blusterer to the fight, Thee on this bank he threw To mark his victory. In this low vale, the promise of the year, Serene, thou openest to the nipping gale, Unnoticed and alone, Thy tender elegance, So Virtue blooms, brought forth amid the storms Of chill adversity in some lone walk Of life she rears her head, Obscure and unobserved While every bleaching breeze that on her blows Chastens her spotless purity of breast, And hardens her to bear Serene the ills of life. - Kirke White.
