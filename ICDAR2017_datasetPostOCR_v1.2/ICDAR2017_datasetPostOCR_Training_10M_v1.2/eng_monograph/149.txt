[OCR_toInput] BK. II. 146 AN ENGLISH ANTHOLOGY. And now thou frown'st, and now I die, My corpse by lovers followed Which straight shall by dead lovers lie That ground is only hallowed. If priests are grieved I have a grave, My death not well approving, The poets my estate shall have, To teach them th' Art of Loving. And now let lovers ring their bells For me, poor youth departed, Who kindly in his love excels, By dying broken-hearted. My grave with flowers let lovers strow, Which if thy tears fall near them, May so transcend in scent and show, As thou wilt shortly wear them. Such flowers how much will florists prize, On lover's grave that growing, Are watered by his mistress' eyes, With pity ever-flowing, A grave so deckt will, though thou art Yet fearful to come nigh me, Provoke thee straight to break thy heart, And lie down boldly by me. Then everywhere all bells shall ring, All light to darkness turning While every choir shall sadly sing, And Nature's self wear mourning. Yet, we hereafter may be found. By destiny's right placing, Making, like flowers, love underground, Whose roots are still embracing. - Davenant
