[OCR_toInput] OF THOMAS OF READING. 113 But clothing kept as it hath beene, In London neuer shall be seene For Weauers then the most shall win, That worke for clothing next the skin. Till pride the Common-wealth doth peele, And causeth huswiues leaue their wheele, Then pouerty vpon each side, Vnto those workemen shall betide. At that time, from Eagles nest, That proudly builded in the West, A sorte shall come with cunning hand, To bring strange weauing in this Land, And by their games that great will fall, They shall maintame the Weauers Hall But long thej- shall not flourish so, But folly will them ouerthrow. And men shall count it mickle shame, To beare that kind of Weauers name, And this as sure shall come to passe, As here is Ale within this glasse. When the sidy soules that sate about him heard him speakeinthis sort, they admired, and honoured Crabbe for the same. Why my masters, said Weasell, doe you wonder at these words ? he will tell you twenty of these tales, for which cause we call him our canuas Prophet his attire fits his title, said they, and we neuer heard the like in our Hues and if this should be true, it would be strange. Doubt not but it will be true, qd. Weasell VOL. i. i
