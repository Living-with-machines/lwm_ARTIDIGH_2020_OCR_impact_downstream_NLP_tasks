[OCR_toInput] MY HELEN FLASH IS THE mum. wmm My Helen is the fairest flower, That ever graced the sun or shade, Or deck'd with charms the lover's bovver, The desert wild, or sunny shade, Her bosoms fairer than the snow, Or April showers or May morns breath, Then moonlight rays or ruby's glow, Than weeping lily closed in death. First I loved William and then I loved John, But now I love Thomas he is a clever young man, With his white cotton stockings, and his high anckled shoes, He wears his velvet jacket, like a flash Lad he goes. For fiddling and dancing is all my delight, And keeping flash company has ruined me quite, Boys and a great many more, If I had not kept bad company, I never had been so poor. So take this yellow handkerchief in remembrance of me, And when it's round your neck love, and your flash company Dry up those briney tears and don't look so sad, For there are many more flash Lads always to be had. Here is adieu to your judges and juries you are too severe, You have banished my true love from me I declara, May the rocks run water, and the rivers run dry, If ever I prove false to the girl that loves I. If the wars should come again love, what would old England say, They would wish for the transports, they have sent far away, They would wish for transports, to return back again, To fight for old England their right to maintain. - •-e '- ___ Jackson and Son, late Russell, Printers J ft - . , s , • Moor street, Birmingham. My Helen is, Her azure eyes when cast above, Is brighter than the starry sky, Her mellow voice in notes of love, First raised my soul to bliss on high, Her cheeks they mock the rose's bloom, Her dear, dear lips, the coral's hue, Her breath, rich India's choice perfume, Her breast is tender, kind and true. My Helen is, c. No other charms can rival these, No other lips such sweets disclose, No other heart hath power to pleas , Poor Helen is a thornless rose, Sportive fancy paints her near me, My memery ever will retain, Thoughts of her I'd wish to cheer me, Through this pilgrimage of pain.
