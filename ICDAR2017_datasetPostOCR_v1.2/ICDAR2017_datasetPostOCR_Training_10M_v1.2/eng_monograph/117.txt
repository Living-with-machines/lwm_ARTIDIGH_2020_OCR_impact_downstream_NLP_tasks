[OCR_toInput] SECT. III. A MOTHER'S BLESSING. 91 LXXIV. PATIENCE. Duke. What comfort do you find in being so calm ? Candida. That which green wounds receive from sovereign balm. Patience, my lord ! why, 'tis the soul of peace Of all the virtues 'tis nearest kin to heaven It makes men look like gods. The best of men That e'er wore earth about him was a sufferer, A soft, meek, patient, humble, tranquil spirit, The first true gentleman that ever breathed. The stock of patience then cannot be poor All it desires, it has what award more ? It is the greatest enemy to law That can be, for it doth embrace all wrongs, And so chains up lawyers and women's tongues 'Tis the perpetual prisoner's liberty, His walks and orchards 'tis the bond-slave's freedom, And makes him seem proud of his iron chain, As though he wore it more for state than pain It is the beggar's music, and thus sings, -Although their bodies beg, their souls are kings. O my dread liege ! it is the sap of bliss, Bears us aloft, makes men and angels kiss And last of all, to end a household strife It is the honey 'gainst a waspish wife. 1602. - Dekker. LXXV. A MOTHER'S BLESSING. Be thou blessed, Bertram ! and succeed thy father In manners as in shape ! Thy blood and virtue Contend for empire in thee and thy goodness Share with thy birthright. Love all, trust a few Do wrong to none be able for thine enemy,
