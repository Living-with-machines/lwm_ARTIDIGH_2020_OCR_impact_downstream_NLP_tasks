[OCR_toInput] BK. II 130 AN ENGLISH ANTHOLOGY. No war, or battle's sound, Was heard the world around The idle spear and shield were high up hung The hooked chariot stood Unstained with hostile blood The trumpet spake not to the armed throng And kings sat still with awful eye, As if they surely knew their sovran Lord was by But peaceful was the night Wherein the Prince of Light His reign of peace upon the earth began The winds, with wonder whist. Smoothly the waters kissed, Whispering new joys to the mild ocean, Who now hath quite forgot to rave. While birds of calm sit brooding on the charmed wave The stars, with deep amaze, Stand fixed in steadfast gaze. Bending one way their precious influence, And will not take their flight For all the morning light, Or Lucifer that often warned them thence But in their glimmering orbs did glow, Until their Lord Himself bespake, and bid them go. And, though the shady gloom Had given day her room, The sun himself withheld his wonted speed, And hid his head for shame, As his inferior flame The new enlightened world no more should need He saw a greater Sun appear Than his bright throne or burning axletree could bear.
