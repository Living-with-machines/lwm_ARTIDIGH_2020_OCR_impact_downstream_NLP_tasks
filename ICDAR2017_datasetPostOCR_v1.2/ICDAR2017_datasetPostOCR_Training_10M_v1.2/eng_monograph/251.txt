[OCR_toInput] III. THE LAWYER'S FAREWELL TO HIS MUSE. SECT 305 'j Or, when in silence all is drowned, Fell murder walks his nightly round No room for peace, no room for you Adieu, celestial Nymph, adieu ! Shakespeare no more, thy sylvan son, Nor all the art of Addison, Pope's heaven-strung lyre, nor Waller's ease Nor Milton's mighty self must please. Instead of these a formal band In furs and coifs around me stand With sounds uncouth and accents dry, That grate the soul of harmony, Each pedant sage unlocks his store Of mystic, dark, discordant lore And points with tottering hand the ways That lead me to the thorny maze. There, in a winding close retreat, Is Justice doomed to fix her seat There, fenced by bulwarks of the Law, She keeps the wondering world in awe And there, from vulgar sight retired, Like Eastern queens is more admired. O let me pierce the secret shade Where dwells the venerable maid ! There humbly mark, with reverent awe, The guardian of Britannia's Law Unfold with joy her sacred page, The united boast of many an age, Where mixed, yet uniform, appears The wisdom of a thousand years In that pure spring the bottom view, Clear, deep, and regularly true And other doctrines thence imbibe Than lurk within the sordid scribe 20
