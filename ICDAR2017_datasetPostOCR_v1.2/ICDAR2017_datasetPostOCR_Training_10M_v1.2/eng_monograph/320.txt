[OCR_toInput] SECT. I. SONNETS. 429 CCCXXIX. ON CHILLON. Eternal Spirit of the chainless Mind ! Brightest in dungeons, Liberty ! thou art, For there thy habitation is the heart -The heart which love of thee alone can bind And when thy sons to fetters are consigned, To fetters, and the damp vault's dayless gloom, Their country conquers with their martyrdom, And Freedom's fame finds wings on every wind. Chillon ! thy prison is a holy place, And thy sad floor an altar, for 'twas trod, Until his very steps have left a trace Worn, as if thy cold pavement were a sod, By Bonnivard ! May none those marks efface ! For they appeal from tyranny to God. - Byron. cccxxx. TO WORDSWORTH. Poet of Nature, thou hast wept to know That things depart which never may return ! Childhood and youth, friendship and love's first glow Have fled like sweet dreams, leaving thee to mourn. These common woes I feel. One loss is mine Which thou, too, feelest yet I alone deplore. Thou wert as a lone star, whose light did shine On some frail bark in winter's midnight roar Thou hast, like to a rock-built refuge, stood Above the blind and battling multitude. In honoured poverty thy voice did weave Songs consecrate to truth and liberty, -Deserting these, thou leavest me to grieve, Thus having been, that thou shouldst cease to be. - Shelley. Cf. Milton's sonnet On the Late Massacre in Piedmont.
