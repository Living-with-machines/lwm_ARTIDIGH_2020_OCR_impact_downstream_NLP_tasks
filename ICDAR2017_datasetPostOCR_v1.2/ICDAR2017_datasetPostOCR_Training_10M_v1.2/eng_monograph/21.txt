A DAMSEL possessed of great beauty, She stood by her own father's gate, The gallant hussars' were on duty, To view them this maiden did wait Their horses were caperiDg and prancing, Their accoutrements shone like a star, From the plain they were nearest advanoing, She espied her young gallant Hussar. Their pellices were slung on their shoulders, So careless they seemed for to ride, So warlike appeared these young soldiers, With glittering swords by their sides.
