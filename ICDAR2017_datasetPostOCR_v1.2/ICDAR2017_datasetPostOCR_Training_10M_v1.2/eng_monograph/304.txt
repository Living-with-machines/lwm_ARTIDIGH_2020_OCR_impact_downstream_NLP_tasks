[OCR_toInput] SECT. I. PEELE CASTLE. 397 So once it would have been, - 'tis so no more I have submitted to a new control A power is gone, which nothing can restore A deep distress hath humanized my soul. Not for a moment could I now behold A smiling sea, and be what I have been The feeling of my loss will ne'er be old This, which I know, I speak with mind serene. Then, Beaumont, friend! who would have been the friend, If he had lived, of him whom I deplore, This work of thine I blame not, but commend This sea in anger, and that dismal shore. 0 'tis a passionate work ! - yet wise and well, Well chosen is the spirit that is here That hulk which labours in the deadly swell, This rueful sky, this pageantry of fear ! And this huge Castle, standing here sublime, I love to see the look with which it braves, Cased in the unfeeling armour of old time, The lightning, the fierce wind, and trampling waves. Farewell, farewell the heart that lives alone, Housed in a dream, at distance from the kind ! Such happiness, wherever it be known, Is to be pitied for 'tis surely blind. But welcome fortitude, and patient cheer, And frequent sights of what is to be borne ! Such sights, or worse, as are before me here -Not without hope we suffer and we mourn. - Wordsworth. He alludes to the loss of his brother John, who was drowned in the Abergavcnny , of which he was commander - the vessel having struck on a rock off Portland, on its voyage to India, 5th Feb., 1805.
