And all the Muses still were in their prime, When, like Apollo, he came forth to warm Our ears, or like a Mercury to charm ! Nature herself was proud of his designs, And joved to wear the dressing of his lines, Which were so richly spun, and woven so fit, As, since, she will vouchsafe no other wit. The merry Greek, tart Aristophanes, Neat Terence, witty Plautus, now not please But antiquated and deserted lie, As they were not of Nature's family. Yet must I not give Nature all thy Art, My gentle Shakspeare, must enjoy a part. For though the poet's matter nature be, His art doth give the fashion and that he Who casts to write a living line, must sweat Such as thine are and strike the second heat Upon the Muses' anvil, turn the same, And himself with it, that he thinks to frame Or for the laurel he may gam a scorn For a good poet's made, as well as born. And such wert thou ! Look, how the father's face Lives in his issue, even so the race Of Shakspeare's mind and manners brightly shines In his well turned and true filed lines, In each of which he seems to shake a lance, As brandished at the eyes of ignorance. Sweet Swan of Avon ! what a sight it were To see thee in our waters yet appear, And make those flights upon the banks of Thames, That so did take Eliza and our James ! That he that man.
