[OCR_toInput] 82 BK. I. AN ENGLISH ANTHOLOGY. LXVII. YOUTH AND AGE. Crabbed Age and Youth cannot live together. Youth is full of pleasance, Age is full of care Youth like summer morn, Age like winter weather, Youth like summer brave, Age like winter bare. Youth is full of sport, Age's breath is short Youth is nimble, Age is lame Youth is hot and bold, Age is weak and cold, Youth is wild, and Age is tame -Age, I do abhor thee, Youth, I do adore thee Oh ! my Love, my Love is young. Age, I do defy thee, - O sweet shepherd, hie thee, For methinks thou stay'st too long. - Shakspere, The Passionate Pilgrim LXVIII. UNDER THE GREENWOOD TREE. Under the greenwood tree Who loves to lie with me, And tune his merry note Unto the sweet bird's throat -Come hither, come hither, come hither ! Here shall he see No enemy But winter and rough weather. Who doth ambition shun And loves to live i' the sun, Seeking the food he eats, And pleased with what he gets -Come hither, come hither, come hither! Here shall he see No enemy But winter and rough weather. - As You Like It, ii. 5
