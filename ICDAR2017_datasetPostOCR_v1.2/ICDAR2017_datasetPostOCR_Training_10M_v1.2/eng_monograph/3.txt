[OCR_toInput] ATRAVELLER STOPPED AT A WIDOW'S GATE. A traveller stopped at a widow's gate She kept an inn and he wanted to bait, But the landlady slighted her guest For, when Nature was making an ugly race, She certainly moulded this traveller's face, As a sample for all the rest. • The chambermaid's sides they were ready to.crack, When she saw the queer nose and the hump on his back A hump isn't handsome no doubt And, though 'tis confessed that the prejudice goes Very strong in favour of wearing a nose, A nose shouldn't look like a snout, A bag full of gold on the table he laid, 'T had a wond'rous effect on the widow and maid, And they quickly grew marvellous civil The money immediately altered the case, They were charmed with his hump, and his snout, and bis face, Though he still might have frightened the devil. DR. STAFFORD AND THE Weavers Daughter. VV- • ■ One evening as I walked by the rocks of Mile, Having all things ready, just going to see a friend s There I espied a young man, of wit and beauty brigM 5-' And to my sad misfortune he proved ray heart's delight. I cannot blame this young man, because he did not know, That love's the sole occasion of my sorrow, grief and woe, I'm afraid the want of money will my sad ruin prove, One look of his sweet countenance would cure the pains of love. We'll send for Dr. Stafford, he being a man of noted skill, To see the Weaver's Daughter, who's lying very ill. Then in came Dr. Stafford, likewise his brother John, Also the Doctor's 'prentice, when they all three came in. She listed up her drowsy head, with a heavy sigh said she, I pray you Doctor Stafford, now use me tenderly, For I am bad and very bad, and in a deep decay Come, Doctor Stafford, near to me, and hand a drink I pray. He handed her a drink and not one word could he say, The tears came rolling down her cheeks, on the pillow where she lay He slipped off his shoes and behind her then he went, And for three weeks and better he did her well attend. The very last words that e'er she spoke, her voice was slow but clear, All goodness be my darling's guide he's the boy that I love dear. I am a sporting young man, scarce eighteen years of age, And many are the pretty girls, who have been with me engaged, Many are the pretty girls who've fallen in love with me, But the Weaver's Daughter loved me best, and she died for love of me. One evening as I walked down by my father's land, a waugh came o'er my shoulder, which put me to a stand. The neighbours they were pleas'd to say her spirit doth haunt me I am sure they are mistaken, for she laid no blame on me. Then straightway into Bedlam this young man is confin'd, He's quite bereft of senses, and even changed his mind, , Her spirit came up to him, and said young man revive F#r I never was ordained to be your wedded wife. He paid like a prince, gave the widow a smack And flopp'd on his horse, at the door, like a sack While the landlady touching the chink, Cried, Sir, should you travel this country again, I heartily hope that the sweetest of men Will stop at the widow's to drink. The MOUNTAIN MAID. The mountain maid from her bower has hied And sped to the glassy river's side, Where the radiant moon shone clear and bright, And the willows waved in a silver light. On a mossy bank lay a shepherd swain, He woke his pipe to tuneful strain, And so blythly gay were the notes he played, That he charmed the ear of the Mountain Maid. She stopped with timid fear oppressed While a soft sigh swell'd the gentle breast, He caught her glance and marked her sigh, And triumph laughed in his sparkling eye. So softly sweet was his tuneful ditty, He charmed ner tender soul to pity And so blithely gay were the notes he played, That he won the heart of the Mountain Maid. Geo.
