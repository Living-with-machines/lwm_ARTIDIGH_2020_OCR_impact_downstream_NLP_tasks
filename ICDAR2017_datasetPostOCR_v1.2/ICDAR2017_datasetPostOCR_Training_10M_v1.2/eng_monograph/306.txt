[OCR_toInput] SECT. I. THE HAPPY WARRIOR. 399 Whence, in a state where men are tempted still To evil for a guard against worse ill, And what in quality or act is best Doth seldom on a right foundation rest, He fixes good on good alone, and owes To virtue every triumph that he knows - Who, if he rise to station of command, Rises by open means and there will stand On honourable terms, or else retire, And in himself possess his own desire Who comprehends his trust, and to the same Keeps faithful with a singleness of aim And therefore does not stoop, nor lie in wait For wealth, or honours, or for worldly state Whom they must follow on whose head must fall, Like showers of manna, if they come at all Whose powers shed round him in the common strife, Or mild concerns of ordinary life, A constant influence, a peculiar grace But who, if he be called upon to face Some awful moment to which Heaven has joined Great issues, good or bad for human kind, Is happy as a Lover and attired With sudden brightness, like a Man inspired And, through the heat of conflict, keeps the law In calmness made, and sees what he foresaw Or if an unexpected call succeed, Come when it will, is equal to the need - He who, though thus endued as with a sense And faculty for storm and turbulence, Is yet a Soul whose master-bias leans To homefelt pleasures and to gentle scenes Sweet images ! which, wheresoe'er he be, Are at his heart and such fidelity.
