[OCR_toInput] SECT. III. ODE ON ETON COLLEGE. 301 I feel the gales that from ye blow A momentary bliss bestow, As waving fresh their gladsome wing, My weary soul they seem to soothe, And, redolent of joy and youth, To breathe a second spring.

The captive linnet which enthral ? What idle progeny succeed To chase the rolling circle's speed, Or urge the flying ball ?

Gay hope is theirs by fancy fed, Less pleasing when possest The tear forgot as soon as shed, The sunshine of the breast Theirs buxom health of rosy hue, Wild wit, invention ever-new,
