[OCR_toInput] BK. IV. 426 AN ENGLISH ANTHOLOGY. But the tender bloom of heart is gone, ere youth itself be past. Then the few whose spirits float above the wreck of happiness Are driven o'er the shoals of guilt or ocean of excess The magnet of their course is gone, or only points in vain The shore to which their shivered sail shall never stretch again. Then the mortal coldness of the soul like death itself comes down It cannot feel for others' woes, it dare not dream its own That heavy chill has frozen o'er the fountain of our tears, And though the eye may sparkle still, 'tis where the ice appears. Though wit may flash from fluent lips, and mirth distract the breast, Through midnight hours that yield no more their former hope of rest 'Tis but as ivy-leaves around the ruined turret wreathe, All green and wildly fresh without, but worn and gray beneath. O could I feel as I have felt, or be what I have been, Or weep as I could once have wept o'er many a vanished scene, As springs in deserts found seem sweet, all brackish though the ' be, So 'midst the withered waste of life, those tears would flow to me ! - Byron. ' I pique myself on these lines being the truest though the most melancholy I ever wrote.' - Letter to Moore,
