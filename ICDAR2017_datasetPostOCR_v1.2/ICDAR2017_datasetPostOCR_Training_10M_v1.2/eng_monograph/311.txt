[OCR_toInput] SECT. I. YOUTH AND AGE. 411 Where stiff the hand, and still the tongue, Of those who fought, and spoke, and sung Here, where the fretted aisles prolong The distant notes of holy song, As if some angel spoke again, ' All peace on earth, good-will to men,' If ever from an English heart, O, here let prejudice depart, And, partial feeling cast aside, Record, that Fox a Briton died ! When Europe crouched to France's yoke And Austria bent, and Prussia broke, And the firm Russian's purpose brave, Was bartered by a timorous slave, Even then dishonour's peace he spurned. The sullied olive-branch returned, Stood for his country's glory fast, And nailed her colours to the mast Heaven, to reward his firmness, gave A portion in this honoured grave, And ne'er held marble in its trust Of two such wondrous men the dust. 1808. - Scott's M arm ion CCCXIII YOUTH AND AGE. Verse, a breeze 'mid blossoms straying, Where Hope clung feeding, like a bee -Both were mine ! Life went a-maying With Nature, Hope, and Poesy, When I was young ! When I was young? Ah, woeful when ! Ah ! for the change 'twixt Now and Then ! ' One of the most perfect poems, for style, feeling, and every thing, that ever was written.'- Leigh Hunt.
