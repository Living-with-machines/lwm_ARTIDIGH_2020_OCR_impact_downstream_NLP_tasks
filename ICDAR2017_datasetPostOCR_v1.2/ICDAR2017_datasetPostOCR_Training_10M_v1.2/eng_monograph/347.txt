[OCR_toInput] SECT. II. A BLESSING FOR EVE. 493 Henceforward, woman, rise To thy peculiar and best altitudes Of doing good and of enduring ill, -Of comforting for ill, and teaching good, And reconciling all that ill and good, Unto the patience of a constant hope, -Rise with thy daughters ! If sin came by thee, And by sin, death, - the ransom-righteousness, The heavenly life and compensative rest, Shall come by means of thee. If woe by thee Had issue to the world, thou shalt go forth An angel of the woe thou didst achieve, Found acceptable to the world instead Of others of that name, of whose bright steps Thy deed stripped bare the hills. Be satisfied Something tnou hast to bear through womanhood, Peculiar suffering answering to the sin, -Some pang paid down for each new human life, Some weariness in guarding such a life, Some coldness from the guarded some mistrust From those thou hast too well served from those beloved Too loyally some treason feebleness Within thy heart, and cruelty without, And pressures of an alien tyranny With its dynastic reasons of larger bones And stronger sinews. But, go to ! Thy love Shall chant itself its own beatitudes, After its own life-working. A child's kiss Set on thy sighing lips shall make thee glad A poor man served by thee shall make thee rich A sick man helped by thee shall make thee strong Thou shalt be served thyself by every sense Of service which thou renderest. - Mrs. Browning, The Drama of Exile.
