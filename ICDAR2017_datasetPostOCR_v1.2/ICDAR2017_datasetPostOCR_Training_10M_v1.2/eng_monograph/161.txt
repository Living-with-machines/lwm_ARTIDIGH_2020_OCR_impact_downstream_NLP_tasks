[OCR_toInput] SECT. I. 165 TO THE QUEEN. Low without creeping, high without loss of wings Smooth, yet not weak, and by a thorough care, Big without swelling, without painting, fair. Great soul of numbers, whom we want and boast, Like curing gold, most valued now thou'rt lost When we shall feed on refuse offals, when We shall from corn to acorns turn again Then shall we see that these two names are one, Jonson and Poetry, which now are gone. ■Cartwright. cxxxiv. TO THE QUEEN ENTERTAINED AT NIGHT BY THE COUNTESS OF ANGLESEY. Fair as unshaded light, or as the day In its first birth, when all the year was May Sweet as the altar's smoke, or as the new Unfolded bud, swelled by the early dew Smooth as the face of waters first appeared, Ere tides began to strive, or winds were heard Kind as the willing saints, and calmer far Than in their sleeps forgiven hermits are. You that are more than our discreeter fear Dares praise, with such full art, what make you here ? Here, where the summer is so little seen, That leaves, her cheapest wealth, scarce reach at green You come, as if the silver planet were Misled a while from her much-injured sphere And, t' ease the travels of her beams to-night, In this small lanthorn would contract her light. - Davenant. Cf. lines 33 and 34 from Denham's Cooper's Hill, page 174.
