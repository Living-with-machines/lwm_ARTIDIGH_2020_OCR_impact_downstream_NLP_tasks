BEYOND THE VEIL. 191 Thou fathomest the deep gulf of ages past, And canst pluck up with ease The years which thou dost please, Like shipwrecked treasures, by rude tempests cast Long since into the sea, Brought up again to light and public use by thee. Nor dost thou only dive so low, but fly With an unwearied wing the other way on high, Where Fates among the stars do grow There into the close nests of Time dost peep, And there, with piercing eye, Through the firm shell and the thick white, dost spy Years to come a-forming lie, Close in their sacred secondinet asleep, Till, hatched by the sun's vital heat, Which o'er them yet does brooding set, J They life and motion get And, ripe at last, with vigorous might Break through the shell, and take their everlasting flight. - Cowley. CLXII. BEYOND THE VEIL. They are all gone into the world of light ! And I alone sit lingering here Their very memory is fair and bright, And my sad thoughts doth clear. It glows and glitters in my cloudy breast, Like stars upon some gloomy grove, Or those faint beams in which this hill is drest, After the sun's remove. The white of an egg. f Sccondinc obsolete , the thin film with which an infant is covered in the womb, so called because it follows the child. This is from the note in the ed. of 1710, and a similar explanation is given in Blount's Dictionary, 1670. In Campbell's and other modern editions of Cowley it is altered to ' fecundine sleep '.
