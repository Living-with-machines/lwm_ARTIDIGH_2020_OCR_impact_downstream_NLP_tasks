[OCR_toInput] bk II 222 AN ENGLISH ANTHOLOGY. Blind among enemies, O worse than chains, Dungeon, or beggary, or decrepit age ! Light, the prime work of God, to me is extinct, And all her various objects of delight Annulled, which might in part my grief have eased Inferior to the vilest now become Of man or worm, the vilest here excel me They creep, yet see I, dark in light, exposed To daily fraud, contempt, abuse, and wrong. Within doors or without, still as a fool, In power of others, never in my own Scarce half I seem to live, dead more than half. O dark, dark, dark, amid the blaze of noon, Irrecoverably dark, total eclipse Without all hope of day ! O first created beam, and thou great Word, ' Let there be light, and light was over all,' Why am I thus bereaved thy prime decree ? The sun to me is dark And silent as the moon, When she deserts the night, Hid in her vacant interlunar cave. Since light so necessary is to life And almost life itself, if it be true That light is in the soul, She all in every part, why was the sight To such a tender ball as the eve confined, So obvious and so easy to be quenched ? And not, as feeling, through all parts diffused, That she might look at will through every pore ? Then had I not been thus exiled from light. As in the land of darkness, yet in light. To live a life half dead, a living death, And buried but, O yet more miserable !
