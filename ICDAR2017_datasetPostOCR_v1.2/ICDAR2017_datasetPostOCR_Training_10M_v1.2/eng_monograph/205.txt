[OCR_toInput] BK. II AN ENGLISH ANTHOLOGY. 242 See the snakes that they rear, How they hiss in their hair, And the sparkles that flash from their eyes ! Behold a ghastly band. Each a torch in his hand ! Those are Grecian ghosts that in battle were slain, And unburied remain Inglorious on the plain. Give the vengeance due To the valiant crew Behold how they toss their torches on high, How they point to the Persian abodes And glittering temples of their hostile gods ! ' The princes applaud with a furious joy And the king seized a flambeau with zeal to destroy Thais led the way, To light him to his prey, And, like another Helen, fired another Troy ! 7-Thus, long ago, Ere heaving bellows learned to blow, While organs yet were mute, Timotheus, to his breathing flute And sounding lyre, Could swell the soul to rage or kindle soft desire. At last divine Cecilia came, Inventress of the vocal frame The sweet enthusiast, from her sacred store, Enlarged the former narrow bounds, And added length to solemn sounds, With Nature's mother-wit, and arts unknown before. Let old Timotheus yield the prize, Or both divide the crown He raised a mortal to the skies, She drew an angel down ! - Dryden
