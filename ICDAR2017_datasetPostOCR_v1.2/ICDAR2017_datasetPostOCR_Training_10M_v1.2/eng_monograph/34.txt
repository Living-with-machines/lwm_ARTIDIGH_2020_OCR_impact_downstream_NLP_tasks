We were first rate old pals, looking after the gals, We had not been out long when we chanced to view, We walked up Regent St., when who should we meet, But two girls who stopp'd with us till the morning. Mind what you're at when you're out with your pals, Don't you get larking along with the gals, Or happen it may to you, as it did to Brown and me, I mean the other night when we went upon the spree.
