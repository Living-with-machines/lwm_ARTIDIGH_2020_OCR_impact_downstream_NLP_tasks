[OCR_toInput] SECT. III. REVENGE OF INJURIES. 107 XCIII. REVENGE OF INJURIES. The fairest action of our human life Is scorning to revenge an injury For who forgives without a further strife, His adversary's heart to him doth tie. And 'tis a firmer conquest, truly said, To win the heart, than overthrow the head. If we a worthy enemy do find, To yield to worth it must be nobly done But if of baser metal be his mind, In base revenge there is no honour won. Who would a worthy courage overthrow, And who would wrestle with a worthless foe ? We say our hearts are great, and cannot yield Because they cannot yield, it proves them poor Great hearts are tasked beyond their power but seld The weakest lion will the loudest roar. Truth's school for certain doth this same allow, High-heartedness doth sometimes teach to bow. A noble heart doth teach a virtuous scorn, -To scorn to owe a duty over-long To scorn to be for benefits forborne To scorn to lie, to scorn to do a wrong To scorn to bear an injury in mind To scorn a free-born heart slave-like to bind. But if for wrongs we needs revenge must have Then be our vengeance of the noblest kind Do we his body from our fury save, And let our hate prevail against our mind ? What can 'gainst him a greater vengeance be, Than make his foe more worthy far than he ? 1613. - Marian, the Fair Queen of Jewry, by Lady Carew.
