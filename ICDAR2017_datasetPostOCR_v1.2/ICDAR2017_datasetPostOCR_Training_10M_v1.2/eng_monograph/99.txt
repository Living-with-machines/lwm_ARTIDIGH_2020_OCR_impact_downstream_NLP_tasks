[OCR_toInput] SECT. II. 69 MERCY. LV. Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth, Fooled by those rebel powers that thee array, Why dost thou pine within, and suffer dearth, Painting thy outward walls so costly gay ? Why so large cost, having so short a lease, Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend ? Shall worms, inheritors of this excess, Eat up thy charge ? Is this thy body's end ? Then, soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss, And let that pine to aggravate thy store Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross Within be fed, without be rich no more So shalt thou feed on Death, that feeds on men, And, Death once dead, there's no more dying then. - Shakspere, Sonnet 146 LVI. MERCY. The quality of mercy is not strained It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven Upon the place beneath it is twice blessed It blesseth him that gives, and him that takes. 'Tis mightiest in the mightiest it becomes The throned monarch better than his crown His sceptre shows the force of temporal power, The attribute to awe and majesty, Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings But mercy is above this sceptered sway, It is enthroned in the hearts of kings, It is an attribute to God himself ' Perhaps the two most completely powerful sonnets in our literature.' - J. A. Symonds.
