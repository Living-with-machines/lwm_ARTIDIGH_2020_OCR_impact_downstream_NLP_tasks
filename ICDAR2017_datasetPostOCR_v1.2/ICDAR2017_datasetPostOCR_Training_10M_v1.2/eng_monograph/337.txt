[OCR_toInput] bk. IV. 464 AN ENGLISH ANTHOLOGY. -Moore When, round the bowl, of vanished years We talk with joyous seeming, -With smiles that might as well be tears, So faint, so sad their beaming While memory brings us back again Each early tie that twined us, Oh ! sweet's the cup that circles then To those we've left behind us ! And when, in other climes, we meet Some isle or vale enchanting, Where all looks flowery, wild, and sweet, And nought but love is wanting We think how great had been our bliss If Heaven had but assigned us To live and die in scenes like this, With some we've left behind us ! As travellers oft look back at eve When eastward darkly going, To gaze upon that light they leave Still faint behind them glowing -So, when the close of pleasure's day To gloom hath near consigned us, We turn to catch one fading ray Of joy that's left behind us. CCCLIX. SONG. TO THE SPIRIT OF DELIGHT. Rarely, rarely, comest thou, Spirit of Delight! Wherefore hast thou left me now Many a day and night ? Many a weary night and day 'Tis since thou art fled away.
