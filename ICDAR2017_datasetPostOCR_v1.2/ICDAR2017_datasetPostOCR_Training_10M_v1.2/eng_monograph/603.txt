W hat, said the rest, is old Cole murdered ? when, I pray you was the dee 1 done ? The other answered, on Friday last. O good Lord, said the women, how was it done, can you tell ? As report goes, said the other, he was rosted aliue. 0 pitifuU ! was hee roasted ? Indeed I heard one say, a man was murdred at London, and that he was sodden at an Inholders house, and serued it to the guests in stead of porke. No neighbour, it was not at London, said another I heare say twas coming from London, at a place caded Colebrook,and it is reported for truth, that the Inholder made pies of him, and penny pasties, yea, and made his owne seruant eate a piece of him. But I pray you good neighbour, can you teU how it was knowne some say, that a horse reuealed it. Now by the masse quoth Grayes wife it was told one of my neighbours, that a certaine horse did speake, and told great things. That sounds like a lie, said one of them. Why, said another, may not a horse speake, as wed as Balaam asse ? It may be, but it is vnlikely, said the third. But where was the horse when he spake ? As some say, qd. she, he was in the field, and had broke out of the stable, where he stood fast locked in mighty strong yron fetters, which hee burst in peeces as they had beene straws, and broke downe the stable doore, and so got away. The good-man comming in at these speeches, asked what that was they talkt of.
