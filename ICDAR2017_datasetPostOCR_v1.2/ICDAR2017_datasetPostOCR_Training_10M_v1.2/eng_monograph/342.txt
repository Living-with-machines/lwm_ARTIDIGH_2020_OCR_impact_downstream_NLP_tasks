[OCR_toInput] SECT. II. A RETROSPECT. 479 CCCLXXIII. ON THE DEPARTURE OF SIR WALTER SCOTT FROM ABBOTSFORD FOR NAPLES. A trouble, not of clouds, or weeping rain, Nor of the setting sun's pathetic light Engendered, hangs o'er Eildon's triple height Spirits of Power, assembled there, complain For kindred Power, departing from their sight While Tweed, best pleased in chanting a blithe strain. Saddens his voice again and yet again. Lift up your hearts, ye mourners ! for the might Of the whole world's good wishes with him goes Blessings and prayers in nobler retinue Than sceptred king or laurelled conqueror knows, Follow this wondrous potentate. Be true, Ye winds of ocean, and the midland sea, Wafting your charge to soft Parthenope ! 1 83 1. - Wordsworth CCCLXXIV. A RETROSPECT. Long time a child, and still a child, when years Had painted manhood on my cheek, was I For yet I lived like one not born to die A thriftless prodigal of smiles and tears, No hope I needed, and I knew no fears. But sleep, though sweet, is only sleep and waking I waked to sleep no more at once o'ertaking The vanguard of my age, with all arrears Of duty on my back. Nor child, nor man, Nor youth, nor sage, I find my head is grey, For I have lost the race I never ran A rathe December blights my lagging May And still I am a child, though I be old Time is my debtor for my years untold. - Hartley Coleridge
