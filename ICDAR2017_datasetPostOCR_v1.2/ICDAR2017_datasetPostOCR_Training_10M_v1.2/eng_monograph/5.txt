[OCR_toInput] FLOWER OF LANCASHIRE J. C'adman, Printer, Manchester. As I walk'd out one morning clear, Down by the Mersey side, My drooping spirits for to cheer, An English girl I spied Like some great goddess with a smile Walked forth this charming fair, She's the blooming rose of England's Isle, And the flower of Lancashire. The graceful form of this lovely lass, With wonder fill'd my eyes, As she tripp'd o'er the dewy grass, My soul was in surprise, My heart said tarry here awhile, Let me your company share, -You're the blooming rose of England's Isle. And the flower of Lancashire. No costly robes adorn'd this fair, ■ But a rustic dress she wore i A A ribbon tied her silken hair, v?V A milking pail she bore. Like some great goddess with a smile As to milk she did repair, She's the blooming rose of England's Isle, And the flower of Lancashire. Her smile would win a prince's heart Or bless a monarch's life, to those she would such joys impart, If blessed with such a wife I mean to tarry here awhile, Hoping her love to acquire, She's the blooming rose of England's Isle, And the flower of Lancashire., To gain this fair maid's free good will, I'll write to her my love, And O ! kind heaven inspire my quill, That it may successful prove ! And if she does my heart beguile, Or refuse my love to share, Then adieu to the rose of England isle And the flower of Lancashire. This world is wide for me to rove, No danger will I fear, If this fair maid denies my love, To some foreign shore I'll steer I'll wander far like some exile, And oft drop an affectionate tear, When I think on the rose of England's Isle, And the flower of Lancashire. SAILOR S FAREWELL A favourite song, sung by Richard Newton, wish great applause. Farewell ! Mary, I must leave thee The anchor's weighed - I must aboard, Do not let my absence grieve thee, Of sorrow do not breathe a word What though the foaming- ocean sever, Me from thee, yet still my heart Loves you, Mary, and will ever, Though stern duty bids us part. Farewell ! Mary, dearest Mary, Do not grieve, I shall return, Crown'd with laurels, pray do smother, That sad sigh, oh ! do not mourn, You unman me with your dndness Oh ! chase these tears off my brow Now round thy lips sweet smiles are creeping Bless thee, Mary, farewell now. Farewel ! Mary, do not weep so, Though I leave thee for awhile, I'll love thee still when on the deepjiow, Cheer my heart with thy sweet smiles. Soothe my parents with thy rindness, And'l bles?thee when faraway Oh ! forgive my youthful blindness, For I can no longer stay. Dearest parents, farewell kindly, Rest content whilst I'm away, Mark that gun, tis to remind me, On shore I can no longer stay The anchor's weigh'd, the sails are spreading, The boat is waiting in the bay, Farewell now all rind relations, Pray for me when far awav.
