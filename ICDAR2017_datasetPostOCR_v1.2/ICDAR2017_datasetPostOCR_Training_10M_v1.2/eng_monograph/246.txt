[OCR_toInput] SECT. III. PROLOGUE, 1747. 297 Cold approbation gave the lingering bays, For those who durst not censure, scarce could praise. A mortal born, he met the general doom, But left, like Egypt's kings, a lasting tomb. The wits of Charles found easier ways to fame, Nor wished forjonson's art, or Shakespere's flame Themselves they studied, as they felt they writ, Intrigue was plot, obscenity was wit. Vice always found a sympathetic friend They pleased their age, and did not aim to mend. Yet bards like these aspired to lasting praise, And proudly hoped to pimp in future days Their cause was general, their supports were strong, Their slaves were willing, and their reign was long Till Shame regained the post that Sense betrayed, And Virtue called Oblivion to her aid. Then crushed by rules, and weakened as refined, For years the power of Tragedy declined From bard to bard the frigid caution crept, Till Declamation roared, whilst Passion slept Yet still did Virtue deign the stage to tread Philosophy remained, though Nature fled But forced at length her ancient reign to quit, She saw great Faustus lay the ghost of Wit Exulting Folly hailed the joyful day, And pantomime and song confirmed her sway. But who the coming changes can presage, And mark the future periods of the Stage ? Perhaps, if skill could distant times explore, New Behns, new Durfeys, yet remain in store Perhaps, where Lear has raved, and Hamlet died, On flying cars new sorcerers may ride Perhaps - for who can guess the effects of chance ?-Here Hunt may box, or Mahomet may dance.
