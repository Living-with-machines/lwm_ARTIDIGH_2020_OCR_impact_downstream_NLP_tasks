[OCR_toInput] BK. Ill AN ENGLISH ANTHOLOGY. 272 Fortune in men has some small difference made, One flaunts in rags, one flutters in brocade The cobbler aproned, and the parson gowned, The friar hooded, and the monarch crowned. ' What differ more you cry than crown and cowl ? ' I'll tell you, friend ! a wise man and a fool. You'll find, if once the monarch acts the monk, Or, cobbler-like, the parson will be drunk, Worth makes the man, and want of it the fellow, The rest is all but leather or prunello. Stuck o'er with titles, and hung round with strings That thou may'st be by kings, or whores of kings Boast the pure blood of an illustrious race, In quiet flow from Lucrece to Lucrece But by your father's worth if yours you rate, Count me those only who were good and great. Go ! if your ancient, but ignoble blood Has crept through scoundrels ever since the flood, Go ! and pretend your family is young, Nor own your fathers have been fools so long. What can ennoble sots, or slaves, or cowards ? Alas ! not all the blood of all the Howards. Look next on greatness say where greatness lies, Where, but among the heroes and the wise ? Heroes are much the same, the point's agreed, From Macedonia's madman to the Swede The whole strange purpose of their lives to find, Or make, an enemy of all mankind ! Not one looks backward, onward still he goes, Yet ne'er looks forward further than his nose. No less alike the politic and wise All sly slow things, with circumspective eyes Men in their loose unguarded hours they take, Not that themselves are wise, but others weak.
