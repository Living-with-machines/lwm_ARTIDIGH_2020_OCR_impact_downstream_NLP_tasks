In silent gaze, the tuneful choir among, Half pleased, half blushing, let the Muse admire, While Bentley leads her sister-art along, And bids the pencil answer to the lyre, See, in their course, each transitory thought, Fixed by his touch, a lasting essence take Each dream, in Fancy's airy colouring wrought, To local symmetry and life awake ! The tardy rhymes, that used to linger on, To censure cold, and negligent of fame In swifter measures animated run, And catch a lustre from his genuine flame. Ah ! could they catch his strength, his easy grace, His quick creation, his unerring line The energy of Pope they might efface, And Dryden's harmony submit to mine But not to one in this benighted age, Is that diviner inspiration given, That burns in Shakspeare's or in Milton's page, The pomp and prodigality of heaven. t As, when conspiring in the diamond's blaze, The meaner gems that singly charm the sight Together dart their intermingled rays, And dazzle with a luxury of light. Enough for me, if to some feeling breast My lines a secret sympathy impart And, as their pleasing influence flows confess'd, A sigh of soft reflection heave the heart. - Gray. These verses are an unfinished poem on the illustrations by Bentley for the edition of Gray's Poems in 1753 see page 320. The torn manuscript was found by Mason after the poet's death and published in his Memoirs of Gray, 1775. The words in italics were supplied by Mason. f 17-20 quoted by the Earl of Carlisle, Portora Speech-day, 1863.
