[OCR_toInput] SECT. II. Richard's despair. 59 XXXIX. RICHARD'S DESPAIR. Scroop. More health and happiness betide my liege, That can my care-tuned tongue deliver him ! Richard.

Our lands, our lives, and all, are Bolingbroke's And nothing can we call our own but death, And that small model of the barren earth Which serves as paste and cover to our bones. For heaven's sake let us sit upon the ground, And tell sad stories of the death of kings -How some have been deposed, some slain in war, Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed, Some poisoned by their wives, some sleeping killed All murdered. For, within the hollow crown That rounds the mortal temples of a king,
