[OCR_toInput] bk. IV 438 AN ENGLISH ANTHOLOGY. Their clay creator the vain title take Of lord of thee, and arbiter of war These are thy toys, and, as the snowy flake, They melt into thy yeast of waves, which mar Alike the Armada's pride, or spoils of Trafalgar. Thy shores are empires, changed in all save thee -Assyria, Greece, Rome, Carthage, what are they ? Thy waters washed them power while they were free, And many a tyrant since their shores obey The stranger, slave, or savage their decay Has dried up realms to deserts - not so thou, Unchangeable, save to thy wild waves play, -Time writes no wrinkle on thine azure brow, -Such as creation's dawn beheld, thou rollest now. Thou- glorious mirror, where the Almighty's form Glasses itself in tempests in all time, Calm or convulsed - in breeze, or gale, or storm, Icing the pole, or in the torrid clime, Dark-heaving - boundless, endless and sublime -The image of Eternity - the throne Of the Invisible even from out thy slime The monsters of the deep are made each zone Obeys thee thou goest forth, dread, fathomless, alone. And I have loved thee, Ocean ! and my joy Of youthful sports was on thy breast to be Borne, like thy bubbles, onward from a boy I wantoned with thy breakers - they to me Were a delight and if the freshening sea Made them a terror - twas a pleasing fear, For I was as it were a child of thee, And trusted to thy billows, far and near, And laid my hand upon thy mane, as I do here. 1818. - Byron.
