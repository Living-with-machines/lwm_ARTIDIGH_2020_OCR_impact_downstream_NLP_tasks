[OCR_toInput] SECT. I. ODE ON THE NATIVITY. 135 And sullen Moloch, fled, Hath left in shadows dread His burning idol all of blackest hue In vain, with cymbals' ring, They call the grisly king, In dismal dance about the furnace blue The brutish gods of Nile as fast, Isis and Orus, and the dog Anubis, haste. Nor is Osiris seen In Memphian grove or green, Trampling the unshowered grass with lowings loud, Nor can he be at rest Within his sacred chest Nought but profoundest Hell can be his shroud In vain with timbrelled anthems dark The sable-stoled sorcerers bear his worshipped ark He feels from Juda's land The dreaded Infant's hand The rays of Bethlehem blind his dusky eyn Nor all the gods beside Longer dare abide, Not Typhon huge ending in snaky twine Our Babe, to show His Godhead true, Can in His swaddling bands control the damned crew, So when the sun in bed, Curtained with cloudy red, Pillows his chin upon an orient wave, The flocking shadows pale Troop to the infernal jail, Each fettered ghost slips to his several grave And the yellow-skirted fays
