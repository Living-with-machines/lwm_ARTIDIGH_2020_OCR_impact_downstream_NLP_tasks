Roll on, thou fair orb, and with gladness pursue The path that conducts thee to splendour again But man's faded glory what change shall renew ? Ah fool ! to exult in a glory so vain ! ' 'Tis night, and the landscape is lovely no more I mourn, but, ye woodlands, I mourn not for you For morn is approaching, your charms to restore, Perfumed with fresh fragrance, and glittering with dew
