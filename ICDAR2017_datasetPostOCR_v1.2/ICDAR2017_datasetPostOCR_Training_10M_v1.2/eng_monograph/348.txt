[OCR_toInput] AN ENGLISH ANTHOLOGY. BK. IV 494 CCCLXXXVII. THE SLEEP. Of all the thoughts of God that are Borne inward into souls afar, Along the Psalmist's music deep, Now tell me if that any is, For gift or grace, surpassing this ' He giveth His beloved, sleep ' ? What would we give to our beloved ? The hero's heart, to be unmoved The poet's star-tuned harp to sweep The patriot's voice, to teach and rouse The monarch's crown, to light the brows ? ' He giveth His beloved, sleep '. What do we give to our beloved ? A little faith, all undisproved A little dust to overweep And bitter memories to make The whole earth blasted for our sake ' He giveth His beloved, sleep '. ' Sleep soft, beloved ! ' we sometimes say, But have no tune to charm away Sad dreams that through the eyelids creep But never doleful dream again Shall break the happy slumber when ' He giveth His beloved, sleep '. O earth, so full of dreary noises ! O men, with wailing in your voices ! O delved gold, the wailers' heap ! O strife, O curse, that o'er it fall ! God strikes a silence through you all, And ' giveth His beloved, sleep '.
