II the n. 2 'Tis chastity, my brother, chastity She that has that is clad in complete steel, And like a quivered nymph with arrows keen May trace huge forests and unharboured heaths. Infamous hills and sandy perilous wilds Where, through the sacred rays of chastity. No savage fierce, bandit, or mountaineer Will dare to soil her virgin purity. Yea, there where very desolation dwells, By grots and caverns shagged with horrid shades, She may pass on with unblenched majesty, Be it not done in pride, or in presumption. Some say, no evil thing that walks by night. In fog or fire, by lake or moorish fen, Blue meagre hag, or stubborn unlaid ghost That breaks his magic chains at curfew time, No goblin, or swart faery of the mine, Hath hurtful power o'er true virginity. Do ye believe me yet, or shall I call Antiquity from the old schools of Greece To testify the arms of chastity ? Hence had the huntress Dian her dread bow, Fair silver-shafted queen for ever chaste, Wherewith she tamed the brinded lioness And spotted mountain pard, but set at nought The frivolous bolt of Cupid gods and men Feared her stern frown, and she was queen o woods. What was that snaky-headed Gorgon shield That wise Minerva wore, unconquered virgin, Wherewith she freezed her foes to congealed stone, Cf.
