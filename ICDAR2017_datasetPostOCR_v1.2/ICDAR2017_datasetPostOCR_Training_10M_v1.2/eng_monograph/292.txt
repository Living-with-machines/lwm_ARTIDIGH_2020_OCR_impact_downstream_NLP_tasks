[OCR_toInput] BK. Ill 370 AN ENGLISH ANTHOLOGY. And undebased by praise of meaner things, That ere through age or woe I shed my wings I may record thy worth with honour due, In verse as musical as thou art true, And that immortalizes whom it sings -But thou hast little need. Where is a book By seraphs writ with beams of heavenly light, On which the eyes of God not rarely look, A chronicle of actions just and bright -There all thy deeds, my faithful Mary, shine And since thou own'st that praise, I spare thee mine - Cowper. CCLXXVIII. A WISH. Mine be a cot beside the hill A bee-hive's hum shall soothe my ear A willowy brook, that turns a mill, With many a fall shall linger near. The swallow, oft, beneath my thatch Shall twitter from her clay-built nest Oft shall the pilgrim lift the latch, And share my meal a welcome guest. Around my ivied porch shall spring Each fragrant flower that drinks the dew And Lucy, at her wheel, shall sing In russet-gown and apron blue. The village-church among the trees, Where first our marriage-vows were given, With merry peals shall swell the breeze And point with taper spire to Heaven. - Rogers
