[OCR_toInput] BK. II 164 AN ENGLISH ANTHOLOGY. CXXXII. TO THE MEMORY OF BEN JONSON. The Muses' fairest light in no dark time, The wonder of a learned age the line Which none can pass the most proportioned wit To nature, the best judge of what was fit The deepest, plainest, highest, clearest pen The voice most echoed by consenting men The soul which answered best to all well said By others, and which most requital made Tuned to the highest key of ancient Rome, Returning all her music with his own In whom with nature study claimed a part, And yet who to himself owed all his art -Here lies Ben Jonson ! every age will look With sorrow here, with wonder on his book, - Cleveland. cxxxm. ON BEN JONSON. Father of poets, though thine own great day, Struck from thyself, scorns that a weaker ray Should twine in lustre with it, yet my flame, Kindled from thine, flies upward towards thy name. Where shall we find a Muse like thine, that can So well present, and show man unto man, That each one finds his twin, and thinks thy art Extends not to the gestures, but the heart ? Where one so showing life to life, that we Think thou taught'st custom, and not custom thee. But thou still put'st true passions on dost write With the same courage that tried captains fight Giv'st the right blush and colour unto things
