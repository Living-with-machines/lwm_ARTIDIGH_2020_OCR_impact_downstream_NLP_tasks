[OCR_toInput] BK. III. AN ENGLISH ANTHOLOGY. 302 i And lively cheer of vigour born The thoughtless day, the easy night. The spirits pure, the slumbers light, That fly the approach of morn. Alas! regardless of their doom, The little victims play ! No sense have they of ills to come, Nor care beyond to-day Yet see how all around 'em wait The ministers of human fate, And black Misfortune's baleful train. Ah, show them where in ambush stand, To seize their prey, the murderous band Ah, tell them, they are men ! These shall the fury Passions tear, The vultures of the mind, Disdainful Anger, pallid Fear, And Shame that skulks behind Or pining Love shall waste their youth. Or Jealousy with rankling tooth. That inly gnaws the secret heart, And Envy wan, and faded Care, Grim-visaged comfortless Despair, And Sorrow's piercing dart. Ambition this shall tempt to rise, Then whirl the wretch from high, To bitter Scorn a sacrifice, And grinning Infamy. The stings of Falsehood those shall try. And hard Unkindness' altered eve. That mocks the tear it forced to flow And keen Remorse with blood defiled,
