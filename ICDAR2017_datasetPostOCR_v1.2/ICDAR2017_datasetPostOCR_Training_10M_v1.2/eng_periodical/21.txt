I wished that our united forces should do battle to the common enemy. I offered to agree to any fair compromise. I pro mised to retire from the field if I were the weaker, and to give all the assistance in my power to your candidate. These offers your candidate rejected, and the contest went on. Still I hoped that no angry feelings would arise be tween us. I trusted we should abstain from personalities towards each other, and that this would be a calm contest of reason. In these my hopes I have been disappointed, and for that disappointment I am not to blame.

The election sincerity because I possessed property in the Church of England you called upon the Dissenters of Southwark to shrink with horror from my opinions you attempted to excite religious animosity and rancour against me like an inquisitor of old, you presume to question me on my re ligious belief, and to summon me before the tribunal of your private judgment. I am glad to meet you here to day, face to face, to answer you, to scoff at your pretensions, and to bid you defiance. I tell you, in the name of re ligious liberty and equality, that no man has a right to interfere with the religious opinions of another man that no man has a right to question or blame the belief of his neighbour. I tell you that in your conduct and language towards me you have been untrue to the great principle of religious liberty-you have been without that charity which is the essence of religious liberty. You have denounced me as the editor of the works of Hobbes of Malmesbury. Electors, I am proud of the fact. I will rest upon it a claim to your support, in opposition to the claim of Mr Miall. He is the editor of the ' Nonconformist.' I am the editor of Hobbes. To compare the two works together would be like comparing the vastest mountain on the earth's surface with the smallest mole-hill. The works of Hobbes will last more centuries than the ' Nonconformist' will days. The writings of Hobbes will live as long as the Anglo-Saxon race and language. They will be read age after age by the studious amongst the millions of our race who will people the two Americas and the islands of the Southern Ocean, and who will wonder at the ignorant and bigoted herd who dared to assail so great a master of thought and language. As one of that herd, Mr Miall, it is your only chance of escaping oblivion. When I com menced this contest I was told by one of Mr Miall's ad mirers thas he was a retired accomplished student, skilled in literature, a lover of learning and wisdom, an acute rea-soner, an able writer, and in every way well fitted to in struct the nation through the public press. I did believe all this, and I felt almost ashamed of entering into a con test with such a person. Now, I ask you, electors, has Mr Miall's conduct with regard to Hobbes been in con formity with the character I have just given ? If you, Mr Miall, had any love of learning, any regard for the litera ture of your country, any reverence for the wisdom of past times, any admiration for beauty of language, vigour of expression, vigour of logic, and boldness of reasoning, though you might, like myself, deem many of Hobbes' opinions erroneous, though you might reject the whole of his doctrines, yet you would have accorded praise, not blame, to me for enabling the student to peruse the works of one of England's most illustrious authors. No, like that Mahometan warrior and bigot, who destroyed the wisdom of ages, you would burn every work, and consume all lite rature that in the slightest degree was at variance with your limited notions-with your own Koran. You have denounced me as the editor of an infidel work I have challenged you, and again challenge you, to make good your assertions. I have called upon you to point out one infidel passage, one single sentence derogatory to Chris tianity in the works of Thomas Hobbes of Malmesbury. Have you, or have you not, read those works ? If you have not read them, what right have you to say that they are infidel productions? If you have read them, then point out one infidel passage in them, one single sentence hostile to Christianity. I defy you to it. You have shrunk from the attempt. You have indirectly acknowledged that no such passages can be found in those works. Would it not have been manly and courageous to have acknowledged your error-to have said that you had never read those works, and that you had been misled with regard to them ? Instead of doing this you have had recourse to subterfuge. First, you have talked about Gibbon. Now tell me, acute logician, able reasoner, what has Gibbon to do with Hobbes, or Hobbes with Gibbon ? Two minds more dissimilar can hardly be found than the philosopher of Malmesbury and the historian of the Roman Empire. Would you, the lover of knowledge, not only destroy the works of our greatest dialectician, but the writings, likewise, of our greatest his torian ? Would you consign to the same flames the ' Le viathan ' and the ' Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire?' Secondly, you have insinuated that some of Hobbes' opinions lead to infidelity. Prove it, I say. Now, I ask, is there a single work renowned in science, in literature, or in art, against which a similar charge has not been brought by some narrow-minded bigot ? It is a well-known historical fact that every great discovery in astro nomy, in natural history, in chemistry, or in any of the physical sciences-that everything which has made us better acquainted with the heavens, with the earth, and overwhelming majority.

IRELAND The Conflict at Ballinhassig.-Mr O'Connell has sent a subscription of twenty guineas towards the relief of the friends and survivors of the persons who lost their lives in the unhappy conflict at Ballinhassig. In the letter to Mr Philip O'Connell, of Cork, which accom panies the donation, Mr O'Connell states that, after the fullest consideration of the verdict of the jurors who sat on the inquest after the Ballinnhassig affair, he has arrived at the conclusion that he fears it is impossible to disturb it. In reference to the conduct of the police he says -'Tis really shocking to think that the police should be employed, with deadly weapons in their hands to decide upon the necessity of arresting persons not guilty of felonious or capital offences. It is a bad system that sanctions the use of murderous weapons upon occa sions where, even if the imputed crime of the slain were really proved, the utmost punishment could not exceed a small fine or a short imprisonment. 1 Great Orange Demonstration at Belfast.-A grand Orange soiree was held in the Music Hall of Belfast on the 4th inst., which was attended by about 1,000 persons, including Lord Roden, Colonel Verner, Mr Watson, Mr Cleland, and other ultra-Orangemen of note. The hall was profusely hung with banners, and decorations strongly expressive of the political and reli gious opinions of the assembly. When tea was over Lord Roden was called to the chair, and the various notables expressed their sentiments in terms of deep sympathy for Mr Watson, and indignation at the conduct of Government. The speech made by the noble chair man at the close of the soiree contained- some passages which may be worth reproducing. Speaking of the act which deprived Mr Watson of the commission of the peace, he said, I cannot but think that it was an enor mously harsh act of the Government to deprive such a man of the commission of the peace and I cannot but think that they themselves must feel that they have acted a very inconsiderate part in degrading that individual, who, in times of danger, acted with spirit in preserving the peace of the country. In reference to an observation of Colonel Verner, who looked upon him Lord Roden as the leader of the Protestants in Ireland, he said he felt himself totally unworthy of the distinction, but added he would give them all the assistance he could-a heart truly devoted to the Protestant interest of Ireland. It is now many years since first I belonged to the Orange Institution, and it was always my pride and happiness to belong to that loyal body. It was in the vigour of youth, when the body was active and the mind clear, that I joined that body and I can say that, in 1836, the period when that body was dissolved at the wish of the Sove reign, its principles were nothing but loyalty to the Throne and Constitution of Great Britain yes, loyalty to the Crown of England was the great end and aim of those institutions. I do not know whether it is a crime to re organize them now or not-I won't say but that will remain for those who know what is best to be done in these trying times to the Protestant interests of the country. Whether it were merely a singular coinci dence, or a concerted stratagem on the part of the Orangemen, does not appear, but the fact of their having adopted the Roden livery gave his lordship singular pleasure - I feel happy that you have chosen for your colours orange and blue, to which you are so much at tached. I am proud of that, for that happens to be the colour of the very ancient livery tremendous cheering of my own family. As the livery of the House of Orleans became the national colours of the French nation, so the old coat of the Joscelyns now floats as the standard of the Orangemen in the same manner the apron of the blacksmith Gao was borne as the type of rebellion against the tyrant Zohak. Lord Roden continued-I know not whether it is a crime, but I don't think it culpable course of his life he was never Drespm -where he experienced more happiness than on L rf 1 occasion.-The 'Dublin Warder,' aweekhOrf journal, after referring to the Lisburn, Belfast, and other demonstrations, says, Preparations for other countv meetings are in progress, and ere the close of this month the voice of Protestant Ireland will have declared to Peel her immutable determination to resist his unjust and ill-timed attempts to stiffle the expression of independent opinion in a free land.

It is said that, in addition to apartments within the walls of the college, the presidents will receive about 800 . per annum, and the vice-presidents 500 . Alarming State of the County of Cavan.-This county has been the theatre of great excitement during the past week, in consequence of proposed de monstrations, Catholic and Protestant, arising out of a singular cause. The following statement from the ' Dub lin Evening Pilot will explain the case -The friends of Mr Robert Henry Southwell having formed a project to raise from the Irish Catholics a sum of 55,000 . to re purchase the Castle-Hamilton estates for him, proclaimed a meeting to be held at Killeshandra on the 8th this day , to give stability to the project meanwhile Mr Southwell and the Rev. Dr Martin had an angry corre spondence, which was made public. The Protestant party announced a meeting on the same day, and determined to take military possession of Killeshandra early on the morning of the 8th, alleging that the meeting of the Ca tholics was to commemorate and take revenge for the battle of Ballynamuck 8th of September, 1798. Terror and confusion reigned through Cavan and Leitrim. Lord Farnham, with a courage equal to the occasion, issued a notice forbidding persons carrying arms to the meeting this was clearly aimed at the Orangemen. His lordship has collected a great military force, cavalry and infantry, and, after consulting with persons of all religious per suasions, and having affidavits as to an impending breach of the peace, has issued a proclamation, the only course which could prevent a regular battle. The Scots Greys, from Dundalk, after a forced march, have just entered Cavan, where there also have arrived a general officer and Major Priestly, from Dublin. The county is, thank God, filled with troops. Lord Farnham will be in Kil leshandra with four regiments at an early hour so it is to be hoped all will go off quietly. Besides Lord Farn-liam's proclamation, the magistrates issued a notice cau tioning all persons against attending either of the meet ings. It is satisfactory to be able to state, that subsequent accounts show that neither of the projected meetings took place. The troops were all in readiness, but fortunately there was no occasion for their services. The ' Dublin Evening Post says - Our letters from Cavan state that all passed off quietly. The Catholic clergy, from their altars on Sunday, enforced the duty of obedience to the law, and of avoiding all occasions of strife and disturbance, and the result was, that the teetotallers, who had abandoned their perfectly legal meeting and noble purpose, afforded no pretext for Orange violence or ag gression. State of the Harvest in Ireland.- Accounts from various parts of the country convey the most gra tifying assurances of the beneficial effects which the last fortnight of fine weather has had upon the crops. The wheat has been partially injured-on that all are agreed but the extent of surface sown last season, and the saving influence of the present fine weather, will yield and bring to perfection at least an average crop. The oat crop is peculiarly fine in every part of the country, and will yield an abundant produce. In the counties of Wicklow, Wexford, Carlow, and Kildare, reaping has been in pro gress during this week. In Meath, Westmeath, and far ther north and west, the harvest is later but next week extensive tracts of country will be ready for the sickle, and the husbandman, we doubt not, will be amply re warded, notwithstanding that the full measure of promise which the month of June held forth will not be realised. There has been a partial failure in the potato crop, but only on lands adjacent to the coast. Generally, however, this crop is excellent in quality, and the yield will be very abundant. The Government and the Orange Magistracy. -Mr Archdall, father of the member for Fermanagh, who had been removed from the deputy-lieutenancy of that county, for attending the Orange meeting in Ennis killen on the 12th ult., will also be deprived of the com mission of the peace.

I now again solemnly call on you before these, the electors of Southwark, whom you wish to repre- sent in Parliament-I challenge you to make good your assertions.

I wished that our united forces should do battle to the common enemy. I o@ﬀered to agree to any fair compromise. I pro- mised to retire from the @ﬁeld if I were the weaker, and to give all the assistance in my power to your candidate. These o@ﬀers your candidate rejected, and the contest went on. Still I hoped that no angry feelings would arise be- tween us. I trusted we should abstain from personalities towards each other, and that this would be a calm contest of reason. In these my hopes I have been disappointed, and for that disappointment I am not to blame. Not one word of disrespect-not one syllable of reproach did I ################# ever ################################################################ blow ? You, Mr. Miall!

I am glad to meet you here to- day, face to face, to answer you, to sco@ﬀ at your pretensions, and to bid you de@ﬁance. I tell you, in the name of re- ligious liberty and equality, that no man has a right to interfere with the religious opinions of another man that no man has a right to question or blame the belief of his neighbour. I tell you that in your conduct and language towards me you have been untrue to the great principle of religious liberty-you have been without that charity which is the essence of religious liberty. You have denounced me as the editor of the works of Hobbes of Malmesbury. Electors, I am proud of the fact@ I will rest upon it a claim to your support, in opposition to the claim of Mr. Miall. He is the editor of the ' Nonconformist.' I am the editor of Hobbes. To compare the two works together would be like comparing the vastest mountain on the earth's surface with the smallest mole‐hill. The works of Hobbes will last more centuries than the ' Nonconformist' will days. The writings of Hobbes will live as long as the Anglo‐Saxon race and language. They will be read age after age by the studious amongst the millions of our race who will people the two Americas and the islands of the Southern Ocean, and who will wonder at the ignorant and bigoted herd who dared to assail so great a master of thought and language. As one of that herd, Mr. Miall, it is your only chance of escaping oblivion. When I com- menced this contest I was told by one of Mr Miall's ad- mirers thas he was a retired accomplished student, skilled in literature, a lover of learning and wisdom, an acute rea- soner, an able writer, and in every way well @ﬁtted to in- struct the nation through the public press. I did believe all this, and I felt almost ashamed of entering into a con- test with such a person. Now, I ask you, electors, has Mr Miall's conduct with regard to Hobbes been in con- formity with the character I have just given ? If you, Mr Miall, had any love of learning, any regard for the litera- ture of your country, any reverence for the wisdom of past times, any admiration for beauty of language, vigour of expression, vigour of logic, and boldness of reasoning, though you might, like myself, deem many of Hobbe's opinions erroneous, though you might reject the whole of his doctrines, yet you would have accorded praise, not blame, to me for enabling the student to peruse the works of one of England's most illustrious authors. No, like that Mahometan warrior and bigot, who destroyed the wisdom of ages, you would burn every work, and consume all lite- rature that in the slightest degree was at variance with your limited notions-with your own Koran. You have denounced me as the editor of an in@ﬁdel work I have challenged you, and again challenge you, to make good your assertions. I have called upon you to point out one in@ﬁdel passage, one single sentence derogatory to Chris- tianity in the works of Thomas Hobbes of Malmesbury. Have you, or have you not, read those works ? If you have not read them, what right have you to say that they are in@ﬁdel productions ? If you have read them, then point out one in@ﬁdel passage in them, one single sentence hostile to Christianity. I defy you to it. You have shrunk from the attempt. You have indirectly acknowledged that no such passages can be found in those works. Would it not have been manly and courageous lo have acknowledged your error-to have said that you had never read those works, and that you had been misled with regard to them ? Instead of doing this you have had recourse to subterfuge. First, you have talked about Gibbon. Now tell me, acute logician, able reasoner, what has Gibbon to do with Hobbes, or Hobbes with Gibbon ? Two minds more dissimilar can hardly be found than the philosopher of Malmesbury and the historian of the Roman Empire. Would you, the lover of knowledge, not only destroy the works of our greatest dialectician, but the writings, likewise, of our greatest his- torian ? Would you consign to the same @ﬂames the ' Le- viathan ' and the ' Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire ?' Secondly, you have insinuated that some of Hobbes' opinions lead to in@ﬁdelity. Prove it, I say. Now, I ask, is there a single work renowned in science, in literature, or in art, against which a similar charge has not been brought by some narrow‐minded bigot@? It is a well- known historical fact that every great discovery in astro- nomy, in natural history, in chemistry, or in any of the physical sciences -that everything which has made us better acquainted with the heavens, with the earth, and ################################################################################################################################# William Molesworth therefore polled 413 votes more than both his opponents united. IRELAND. ################################ O'Connell has sent a subscription of twenty guineas towards the relief of the friends and survivors of the persons who lost their lives in the unhappy con@ﬂict at Ballinhassig. In the letter to Mr Philip O'Connell, of Cork, which accom- panies the donation, Mr O'Connell states that, after the fullest consideration of the verdict of the jurors who sat on the inquest after the Ballinnhassig a@ﬀair, he has arrived at the conclusion that he fears it is impossible to disturb it. In reference to the conduct of the police he says - 'Tis really shocking to think that the police should be employed, with deadly weapons in their hands, to decide upon the necessity of arresting persons not guilty of felonious or capital o@ﬀences. It is a bad system that sanctions the use of murderous weapons upon occa- sions where, even if the imputed crime of the slain were really proved, the utmost punishment could not exceed a small @ﬁne or a short imprisonment. ########################################## grand Orange soiree was held in the Music Hall of Belfast on the 4th inst., which was attended by about 1,000 persons, including Lord Roden, Colonel Verner, Mr Watson, Mr Cleland, and other ultra‐Orangemen of note. The hall was profusely hung with banners@ and decorations strongly expressive of the political and reli- gious opinions of the assembly. When tea was over Lord Roden was called to the chair, and the various notables expressed their sentiments in terms of deep sympathy for Mr Watson, and indignation at the conduct of Government. The speech made by the noble chair- man at the close of the soiree contained@ some passages which may be worth reproducing. Speaking of the act which deprived Mr Watson of the commission of the peace, he said, I cannot but think that it was an enor- mously harsh act of the Government to deprive such a man of the commission of the peace and I cannot but think that they themselves must feel that they have acted a very inconsiderate part in degrading that individual, who, in times of danger, acted with spirit in preserving the peace of the country. In reference to an observation of Colonel Verner, who looked upon him Lord Roden as the leader of the Protestants in Ireland, he said he felt himself totally unworthy of the distinction, but added he would give them all the assistance he could-a heart truly devoted to the Protestant interest of Ireland. It is now many years since @ﬁrst I belonged to the Orange Institution, and it was always my pride and happiness to belong to that loyal body. It was in the vigour of youth, when the body was active and the mind clear, that I joined that body and I can say that, in 1836, the period when that body was dissolved at the wish of the Sove- reign, its principles were nothing but loyalty to the Throne and Constitution of Great Britain yes, loyalty to the Crown of England was the great end and aim of those institutions. I do not know whether it is a crime to re- organize them now or not-I won't say but that will remain for those who know what is best to be done in these trying times to the Protestant interests of the country. Whether it were merely a singular coinci- dence, or a concerted stratagem on the part of the Orangemen, does not appear, but the fact of their having adopted the Roden livery gave his lordship singular pleasure - I feel happy that you have chosen for your colours orange and blue, to which you are so much at- tached. I am proud of that, for that happens to be the colour of the very ancient livery tremendous cheering of my own family. As the livery of the House of Orleans became the national colours of the French nation, so the old coat of the Joscelyns now @ﬂoats as the standard of the Orangemen in the same manner the apron of the blacksmith Gao was borne as the type of rebellion against the tyrant Zohâk. Lord Roden continued- I know not whether it is a crime, but I don't think it culpable ############################################# he experienced more happiness than on ###### occasion.-The 'Dublin Warder,' aweekly Orange journal, after referring to the Lisburn, Belfast, and other demonstrations, says, Preparations for other county meetings are in progress, and ere the close of this month the voice of Protestant Ireland will have declared to Peel her immutable determination to resist his unjust and ill- timed attempts to sti@fﬂe the expression of independent opinion in a free land.

In reply to applications made on their behalf, candidates, we understand, are informed that no selection has yet been made-that no engagements have been entered into, nor assurances given-that the choice will be determined solely by considerations of personal cha- racter and by moral and intellectual quali@ﬁcations. It is said that, in addition to apartments within the walls of the college, the presidents will receive about 800l. per annum, and the vice‐presidents 500l. ########################################### county has been the theatre of great excitement during the past week, in consequence of proposed de- monstrations, Catholic and Protestant, arising out of a singular cause. The following statement from the ' Dub- lin Evening Pilot' will explain the case - The friends of Mr Robert Henry Southwell having formed a project to raise from the Irish Catholics a sum of 55,000l. to re- purchase the Castle‐Hamilton estates for him, proclaimed a meeting to be held at Killeshandra on the 8th this day , to give stability to the project meanwhile Mr Southwell and the Rev. Dr Martin had an angry corre- spondence, which was made public. The Protestant party announced a meeting on the same day, and determined to take military possession of Killeshandra early on the morning of the 8th, alleging that the meeting of the Ca- tholics was to commemorate and take revenge for the battle of Ballynamuck 8th of September, 1798. Terror and confusion reigned through Cavan and Leitrim. Lord Farnham, with a courage equal to the occasion, issued a notice forbidding persons carrying arms to the meeting this was clearly aimed at the Orangemen. His lordship has collected a great military force, cavalry and infantry, and, after consulting with persons of all religious per- suasions, and having a@@ﬃdavits as to an impending breach of the peace, has issued a proclamation, the only course which could prevent a regular battle. The Scots Greys, from Dundalk, after a forced march, have just entered Cavan, where there also have arrived a general o@@ﬃcer and Major Priestly, from Dublin. The county is, thank God, @ﬁlled with troops. Lord Farnham will be in Kil- leshandra with four regiments at an early hour so it is to be hoped all will go o@ﬀ quietly. Besides Lord Farn- ham's proclamation, the magistrates issued a notice cau- tioning all persons against attending either of the meet- ings. It is satisfactory to be able to state, that subsequent accounts show that neither of the projected meetings took place. The troops were all in readiness, but fortunately there was no occasion for their services. The ' Dublin Evening Post' says - Our letters from Cavan state that all passed o@ﬀ quietly. The Catholic clergy, from their altars on Sunday, enforced the duty of obedience to the law, and of avoiding all occasions of strife and disturbance, and the result was, that the teetotallers, who had abandoned their perfectly legal meeting and noble purpose, a@ﬀorded no pretext for Orange violence or ag- gression. ########################################## from various parts of the country convey the most gra- tifying assurances of the bene@ﬁcial e@ﬀects which the last fortnight of @ﬁne weather has had upon the crops. The wheat has been partially injured-on that all are agreed but the extent of surface sown last season, and the saving in@ﬂuence of the present @ﬁne weather, will yield and bring to perfection at least an average crop. The oat crop is peculiarly @ﬁne in every part of the country, and will yield an abundant produce. In the counties of Wicklow, Wexford, Carlow, and Kildare, reaping has been in pro- gress during this week. In Meath, Westmeath, and far- ther north and west, the harvest is later but next week extensive tracts of country will be ready for the sickle, and the husbandman, we doubt not, will be amply re- warded, notwithstanding that the full measure of promise which the month of June held forth will not be realised.
