The order was instantly obeyed, but all the efforts of the crew were ineffectual. The deceased sunk and was seen no more. No appearance of insanity was attached to him, as far as those on board had opportunity of ascertain ing during the voyage, but he was observed to be exceed ingly low spirited and restless. On Friday night he partook of tea with the rest of the passengers, and he sat in the cabin all night. On Saturday morning he took breakfast alone. At about two o'clock in the afternoon he had a small bottle of porter and a biscuit, and after the other passengers had dined, he dined by himself on deck, and soon after he had finished his meal, he committed himself to the waves. He was about 5 feet 8 inches high, had a round face, appeared to be 30 or 31 years of age, and was dressed in a laglioni coat, light drab trousers, light waistcoat, light handkerchief, and Wellington boots. According to the best of the recol lection of Mr Barrow, the clerk of the William Darley, the deceased had a watch in his pocket at the time he jumped overboard. A certificate was handed to the Lord Mayor, signed by the whole of the passengers, to the effect that every exertion was made by the captain to save the unfortunate man. A passenger was booked as Mr H. C dl, Norwich, who was supposed to be the gentleman who drowned him self, as a box, with his name upon it, was left on board, and had not been claimed. There was also a light leather port manteau, a coat, and fishing tackle, unclaimed. The de ceased was said to have destroyed himself just as the other passengers had all moved to the opposite side of the vessel to look at the Gazelle steamer, which was rapidly passing along. Rebecca Again.-In carrying out the provisions of the late Act of Parliament relating to the Turnpike trusts in South Wales, some of the gates in the neighbourhood of Brecon have already been removed, the tolls reduced, and the distances between othergates are about being equalized. Among the latter ihe turnpike-gate near the ninth mile stone on the Merthyr road is to be removed, and a new toll-house erected this side of the Storys Arms. This build ing was last week in course of erection, and in a few days expected to be finished, but on Monday morning last, upon the workmen going to their work, the new toll house had disappeared, and the men were struck with astonishment at the industry displayed by the parties who had in so short a period levelled their work.-' Hereford Paper.' Fatal Outrage at Newmarket.-A most painful interest has been produced in this town by the perpetration of a premeditated and brutal outrage upon the person of a highly respectable inhabiiant, whose death is universally deplored. The name of the deceased is Henry Thom, who carried on business as a hatter. The accused is Richard Archer, for some time managing clerk to a solicitor. The origin of the quarrel between the parties arose out of some proceedings in the Bankruptcy Court relative to the affairs of a person named Edward Edwards, against whom a fiat had been issued. The creditors having resolved to oppose Edwards, the deceased Mr Thom was selected to conduct the opposition. It seems that Archer was a personal friend of the bankrupt and though Thom did not in any way exceed the duty which he was called on to perform, he pro voked the hostility of Archer, who repeatedly proclaimed his determination to have revenge. These threats he found opportunity for carrying into fatal effect on Saturday evening last, when, meeting the deceased in the market place near his own door, Archer, after a few angry words, struck Mr Thom two heavy blows, which knocked him down, causing contusion of the brain. The deceased was carried home in a state of insensibility, and he died on Sunday morning. Archer has since absconded. Strike on the North British Railway.-On Mon day morning last, nearly five hundred men in the Cock-burnspath district, who have received from 14s. to 16s. per week, struck for an advance of wages to 20s. This demand being refused, the men proceeded along the line towards Berwick, and compelled every man whom they met to stop liis work and join them. Where their commands were not promptly complied with, the mob carried them into effect by force, and, in consequence, the movement was joined by a great number of men along the line. About 1,400 men altogether struck work-an alarming state of things cer tainly, when we consider that neither in this town nor within twenty miles is there any adequate military or civil force. About 400 of the men remained at Ayton, and several hundreds at other places. On Wednesday morning a number of the men assembled at the hiring place for siiearers, but would not allow them to be hired except on their terms. The wages offered by the farmers were Is. 8d. per day, but the navies in. isted that they should receive 3s. or they should not be hired at all. The magistrates, we understand, having taken into consideration the defenceless state of the town, and the facility with which such a body of men might commit any outrage, have resolved to make an application for a detachment of military to be stationed at Berwick. On Wednesday a few of the men returned to their work on Mr Dodds's contract, and on Thursday morning the greater number of Mr Evans's men also re turned They have not received any advance of wages.-' Berwick Warder.' 589 Dreadful Occurrence.-A Man Literally Dis solved.-A young man, named Joseph Brammey, residing at Hadfield, in Glossop, Derbyshire, and employed at the Dinting Vale print works, belonging to Mr Potter, was lately found in a pan containing 300 gallons of caustic ley, which was at a boiling heat. How he came in is not known but it is supposed that he went to the top of the pan to see if the ley was boiling, and, standing on the edge, must have fallen into the horrible grave. The deceased had not been seen about the premises after twenty minutes past ten o'clock. At a quarter past one Robert Stubes went to stir up the liquor in the pan, when to his great alarm he discovered some of the deceased's clothes, the body being quite eaten away by the liquor. Assistance was immediately procured, and search made for the remains of the deceased. The liquor in the pan was thrown away, and at the bottom of the pan nothing but a few bones could he found, and these looking as if they had been in the ground a hundred years. The leather and soles of his clogs were eaten away a portion of his clothes, that were made of cotton, had sustained little injury and the irons and nails that had been in his clogs were found. The deceased's teeth were discovered all separate. Strange to say, the deceased's heart was found by itself quite sound. All that was collected of the body did not weigh 71bs., and if these parts had remained in the liquor three hours longer not a particle would have been left. The deceased was about 17 years of age.-' Derby Mercury.' Singular Death.-Last week a man named David Bol-lison, about 27 years of age, by trade a butcher, living in s j!' eet ,a P ton gate, was engaged in carrying a young c . . ? the slaughterhouse, and whilst proceeding along with the animal upon his shoulders, it suddenly turned its head round, and caught his throat with its teeth, and did not release its hold until the unfortunate man was strangled. He was conveyed home, and a surgeon immediately tried every means to restore him, but to no effect. The sudden ness of the attack caused the unfortunate man to fall to the ground, and having hold of the animal's feet with both hands, prevented him extricating himself from his anta gonist. ady and the Leopard. - On Monday night Mr Gieen made another ascent in his Nassau balloon from the gardens of Cremorne house, and it being announced that he would be accompanied by a lady and a leopard, a y nW rge com P at, y were assembled, there being nearly 12,000 persons present. At half-past six, a female, together with a young male leopard, the property of a Mr White, a trainer of beasts, and the keeper, made their appearance upon the grounds. A car had been prepared for the occa sion, and attached beneath the regular one. The three having entered it, Mr Green placed himself in the upper car, when they proceeded to make several ascents to the height of the trees, at the conclusion of which the aeronaut made preparations for his final ascent with Mrs Green, Mrs C. Green, Mr Salter, Mr Hardwicke the magistrate , Mr Li tlejohn, c., in all eleven persons. The balloon having been released, took a south -westerly direction, in which course it proceeded for some time, when entering another current of air, it returned towards the gardens, over which it hovered for some time, and finally it descended at Notting hill, about half-past eight, and Mr Green returned to the gardens. How to raise the Wind. - The following strange story lias appeared in a French paper - Madame C , wife of a mercer, who has lately been successful in railway operations, has been for a length of time enamoured of play, and during the past winter she lost almost constantly. Her husband at last refused to pay a sou of her play debts, so that the lady gambler was often in difficulties. She returned home a few nights since, after having lost a large sum at lansquinet, mul remained up pondering by what means she could contrive to discharge her obligations. Whilst thus occupied she heard a noise in an adjoining closet. She rose at once, and opening the door found the eldest servant of the family endeavouring to pick the lock of an armoire-a glace in which she kept her jewels. The man was thunder struck at the appearance of his mistress, and prayed her most earnestly not to inform against him. An idea sud denly occurred to Madame C . ' Listen to me,'said she. 'It is you who have already robbed me on several occa sions the act I have caught you in proves it. You will be sent to the galleys if I inform against you. There is one way of escaping I want 10,000f. You have a quantity of picklocks in your hand. If you open your master's safe and take out that sum for me, and no more, I shall say nothing about what I have seen to-night.' The conditions were hard, but the man consented. Scarcely, however, had he introduced one of the instruments into the lock of the safe, when a loud detonation was heard, and the man fell to the ground, dreadfully wounded by a ball from a pistol, which M. C had got fixed inside to prevent robbery. M. C arrived in a minute after, and was the first to lift up the man, who still had the picklocks in his hand. The commissary of police being sent for, received from the thief a full state ment of what had taken place. He was removed to the Hospital St Louis, where he lies in the utmost danger. Madame C-, who denies most strongly the truth of the man's declaration, has withdrawn to her family. Fires.-On Wednesday morning a fire, which was not subdued until property to a considerable extent had been destroyed, broke out in the back workshops belonging to Mrs H. Fowler, an extensive skin-dyer, situate at No. 12 Eagle court, St John's lane, Clerkenwell-a densely popu lated and closely packed locality. The workshops were composed of brick and timber they were two stories high, and between sixty and seventy feet long. They were entirely burned down, and the valuable stock in trade contained in them consumed. Several other houses and workshops were greatly injured, and the whole damage will amount to a con siderable sum. Mrs Fowler was insured, but the majority of the other sufferers were not so fortunate. On the same morning the premises belonging to Mr Gilham, painter and glazier, Tottenham court road, were discovered to be on fire. The flames originated in the front shop, and passed from thence to the back parlour on the same floor. Owing to the large quantity of stock in the place, which was of a highly combustible nature, the flames spread with the greatest fury, speedily enveloping the ground floor. The inmates, after much trouble, managed to get out of the burning building, but they had not time to dress themselves. The whole of Mr Gilham's stock was consumed, and the ground floor burned out. Unfortunately the proprietor was not insured. On Sunday night a fire broke out in the premises belonging to Mr Grogan, oil cloth manufac-facturer and japanner, carrying on business in Princes place, Walworth common. It originated in the manufac tory, a building between fifty and sixty feet long, which was filled with goods, some finished and others partly so.

From Messrs Gillies and Horne's Circular.

The deceased sunk and was seen no more. No appearance of insanity was attached to him, as far as those on board had opportunity of ascertain- ing during the voyage, but he was observed to be exceed- ingly low-spirited and restless. On Friday night he partook of tea with the rest of the passengers, and he sat in the cabin all night. On Saturday morning he took breakfast alone. At about two o'clock in the afternoon he had a small bottle of porter and a biscuit, and after the other passengers had dined, he dined by himself on deck, and soon after he had @ﬁnished his meal, he committed himself to the waves. He was about 5 feet 8 inches high, had a round face, appeared to be 30 or 31 years of age, and was dressed in a Taglioni coat, light drab trousers, light waistcoat, light handkerchief, and Wellington boots. According to the best of the recol- lection of Mr Barrow, the clerk of the William Darley, the deceased had a watch in his pocket at the time he jumped overboard. A certi@ﬁcate was handed to the Lord Mayor, signed by the whole of the passengers, to the e@ﬀect that every exertion was made by the captain to save the unfortunate man. A passenger was booked as Mr H. Coll, Norwich, who was supposed to be the gentleman who drowned him- self, as a box, with his name upon it, was left on board, and had not been claimed. There was also a light leather port- manteau, a coat, and @ﬁshing tackle, unclaimed. The de- ceased was said to have destroyed himself just as the other passengers had all moved to the opposite side of the vessel to look at the Gazelle steamer, which was rapidly passing along. ################# carrying out the provisions of the late Act of Parliament relating to the Turnpike trusts in South Wales, some of the gates in the neighbourhood of Brecon have already been removed, the tolls reduced, and the distances between other gates are about being equalized. Among the latter the turnpike-gate near the ninth mile- stone on the Merthyr road is to be removed, and a new toll-house erected this side of the Storys Arms. This build- ing was last week in course of erection, and in a few days expected to be @ﬁnished, but on Monday morning last, upon the workmen going to their work, the new toll- house had disappeared, and the men were struck with astonishment at the industry displayed by the parties who had in so short a period levelled their work.-' Hereford Paper.' ############################# most painful interest has been produced in this town by the perpetration of a premeditated and brutal outrage upon the person of a highly respectable inhabitant, whose death is universally deplored. The name of the deceased is Henry Thom, who carried on business as a hatter. The accused is Richard Archer, for some time managing clerk to a solicitor. The origin of the quarrel between the parties arose out of some proceedings in the Bankruptcy Court relative to the a@ﬀairs of a person named Edward Edwards, against whom a @ﬁat had been issued. The creditors having resolved to oppose Edwards, the deceased Mr Thom was selected to conduct the opposition. It seems that Archer was a personal friend of the bankrupt and though Thom did not in any way exceed the duty which he was called on to perform, he pro- voked the hostility of Archer, who repeatedly proclaimed his determination to have revenge. These threats he found opportunity for carrying into fatal e@ﬀect on Saturday evening last, when, meeting the deceased in the market- place near his own door, Archer, after a few angry words, struck Mr Thom two heavy blows, which knocked him down, causing contusion of the brain. The deceased was carried home in a state of insensibility, and he died on Sunday morning. Archer has since absconded. ####################################### Mon- day morning last, nearly @ﬁve hundred men in the Cock- burnspath district, who have received from 14s. to 16s. per week, struck for an advance of wages to 20s. This demand being refused, the men proceeded along the line towards Berwick, and compelled every man whom they met to stop @his work and join them. Where their commands were not promptly complied with, the mob carried them into e@ﬀect by force, and, in consequence, the movement was joined by a great number of men along the line. About 1,400 men altogether struck work-an alarming state of things cer- tainly, when we consider that neither in this town nor within twenty miles is there any adequate military or civil force. About 400 of the men remained at Ayton, and several hundreds at other places. On Wednesday morning a number of the men assembled at the hiring place for s@hearers, but would not allow them to be hired except on their terms. The wages o@ﬀered by the farmers were 1s. 8d. per day, but the navies in@sisted that they should receive 3s. or they should not be hired at all. The magistrates, we understand, having taken into consideration the defenceless state of the town, and the facility with which such a body of men might commit any outrage, have resolved to make an application for a detachment of military to be stationed at Berwick. On Wednesday a few of the men returned to their work on Mr Dodds's contract, and on Thursday morning the greater number of Mr Evans's men also re- turned. They have not received any advance of wages.-' Berwick ############################################################### young man, named Joseph Brammey, residing at Had@ﬁeld, in Glossop, Derbyshire, and employed at the Dinting Vale print works, belonging to Mr Potter, was lately found in a pan containing 300 gallons of caustic ley, which was at a boiling heat. How he came in is not known but it is supposed that he went to the top of the pan to see if the ley was boiling, and, standing on the edge, must have fallen into the horrible grave. The deceased had not been seen about the premises after twenty minutes past ten o'clock. At a quarter past one Robert Stubes went to stir up the liquor in the pan, when to his great alarm he discovered some of the deceased's clothes, the body being quite eaten away by the liquor. Assistance was immediately procured, and search made for the remains of the deceased. The liquor in the pan was thrown away, and at the bottom of the pan nothing but a few bones could he found, and these looking as if they had been in the ground a hundred years. The leather and soles of his clogs were eaten away a portion of his clothes, that were made of cotton, had sustained little injury and the irons and nails that had been in his clogs were found. The deceased's teeth were discovered all separate. Strange to say, the deceased's heart was found by itself quite sound. All that was collected of the body did not weigh 7lbs., and if these parts had remained in the liquor three hours longer not a particle would have been left. The deceased was about 17 years of age.-' Derby Mercury.' #################### week a man named David Bol- lison, about 27 years of age, by trade a butcher, living in ################## gate, was engaged in carrying a young calf to the slaughterhouse, and whilst proceeding along with the animal upon his shoulders, it suddenly turned its head round, and caught his throat with its teeth, and did not release its hold until the unfortunate man was strangled. He was conveyed home, and a surgeon immediately tried every means to restore him, but to no e@ﬀect. The sudden- ness of the attack caused the unfortunate man to fall to the ground, and having hold of the animal's feet with both hands, prevented him extricating himself from his anta- ############################ -@On Monday night Mr Green made another ascent in his Nassau balloon from the gardens of Cremorne house, and it being announced that he would be accompanied by a lady and a leopard, a very ################## were assembled, there being nearly 12,000 persons present. At half-past six, a female, together with a young male leopard, the property of a Mr White, a trainer of beasts, and the keeper, made their appearance upon the grounds. A car had been prepared for the occa- sion, and attached beneath the regular one. The three having entered it, Mr Green placed himself in the upper car, when they proceeded to make several ascents to the height of the trees, at the conclusion of which the aeronaut made preparations for his @ﬁnal ascent with Mrs Green, Mrs C. Green, Mr Salter, Mr Hardwicke the magistrate , Mr ########### c., in all eleven persons. The balloon having been released, took a south@-westerly direction, in which course it proceeded for some time, when entering another current of air, it returned towards the gardens, over which it hovered for some time, and @ﬁnally it descended at Notting hill, about half-past eight, and Mr Green returned to the gardens. ###################### -@The following strange story @has appeared in a French paper - Madame C-, wife of a mercer, who has lately been successful in railway operations, has been for a length of time enamoured of play, and during the past winter she lost almost constantly. Her husband at last refused to pay a sou of her play debts, so that the lady gambler was often in di@@ﬃculties. She returned home a few nights since, after having lost a large sum at lansquinet, and remained up pondering by what means she could contrive to discharge her obligations. Whilst thus occupied she heard a noise in an adjoining closet. She rose at once, and opening the door found the eldest servant of the family endeavouring to pick the lock of an armoire-a glace in which she kept her jewels. The man was thunder- struck at the appearance of his mistress, and prayed her most earnestly not to inform against him. An idea sud- denly occurred to Madame C-. ' Listen to me,' said she. ' It is you who have already robbed me on several occa- sions the act I have caught you in proves it. You will be sent to the galleys if I inform against you. There is one way of escaping I want 10,000f. You have a quantity of picklocks in your hand. If you open your master's safe and take out that sum for me, and no more, I shall say nothing about what I have seen to-night.' The conditions were hard, but the man consented. Scarcely, however, had he introduced one of the instruments into the lock of the safe, when a loud detonation was heard, and the man fell to the ground, dreadfully wounded by a ball from a pistol, which M. C-had got @ﬁxed inside to prevent robbery. M. C-arrived in a minute after, and was the @ﬁrst to lift up the man, who still had the picklocks in his hand. The commissary of police being sent for, received from the thief a full state- ment of what had taken place. He was removed to the Hospital St Louis, where he lies in the utmost danger. Madame C-, who denies most strongly the truth of the man's declaration, has withdrawn to her family. FIRES.-On Wednesday morning a @ﬁre, which was not subdued until property to a considerable extent had been destroyed, broke out in the back workshops belonging to Mrs H. Fowler, an extensive skin-dyer, situate at No. 12 Eagle court, St John's lane, Clerkenwell-a densely popu- lated and closely packed locality. The workshops were composed of brick and timber they were two stories high, and between sixty and seventy feet long. They were entirely burned down, and the valuable stock in trade contained in them consumed. Several other houses and workshops were greatly injured, and the whole damage will amount to a con- siderable sum. Mrs Fowler was insured, but the majority of the other su@ﬀerers were not so fortunate.-On the same morning the premises belonging to Mr Gilham, painter and glazier, Tottenham court road, were discovered to be on @ﬁre. The @ﬂames originated in the front shop, and passed from thence to the back parlour on the same @ﬂoor. Owing to the large quantity of stock in the place, which was of a highly combustible nature, the @ﬂames spread with the greatest fury, speedily enveloping the ground @ﬂoor. The inmates, after much trouble, managed to get out of the burning building, but they had not time to dress themselves. The whole of Mr Gilham's stock was consumed, and the ground @ﬂoor burned out. Unfortunately the proprietor was not insured.-On Sunday night a @ﬁre broke out in the premises belonging to Mr Grogan, oil cloth manufac- facturer and japanner, carrying on business in Princes place, Walworth common. It originated in the manufac- tory, a building between @ﬁfty and sixty feet long, which was @ﬁlled with goods, some @ﬁnished and others partly so.
