In pity to the Assistant Commissioner it was high time to stop the inquiry into the conduct of worthy Mr M'Dougal, of the Andover Union Work-house. Thirteen days of self-exposure was quite as much as Mr Parker could bear. His zeal was vast, but his dexterity mean, and wretchedly clumsy were his attempts to screen the accused, to abash the witnesses, and obstruct the discovery of the truth. Under M3 countenance and encourage ment, however, the professional licence had full indulgence, and the Counsel for M'Dougal gave a turn of ribaldry and indecency to the examination to the last degree disgusting. Iudeed, gross as are the offences charged, they are less scandalous, less pernicious, less mischievous in example than the attempts to screen them from detection and punishment, which hold out the promise of impu nity to every licentious brute who happens to be placed at the head of a workhouse. The principle that has governed the inquiry seems to have been, that paupers were to be supposed incapable of speaking the truth and that if any immorality could be charged against their previous lives, any immorality could be practised towards them with impunity. One woman replied, with point and spirit, upon the attempt to invalidate her evidence on the score of character, that it did not follow that because she had been bad before, the master was to make her sin again against her will. M'Dougal has not had the opportunity of making his defence, and therefore we shall not give any opinion on the host of evidence against him but whatever may be the merits of the case, the par tiality of the Assistant Commissioner in the inves tigation of it allows of no dispute, it is as flagrant as folly and injustice combined could make it. We could quote a score of gross instances, but the ex ample we give will serve as well as a hundred. A witness was giving evidence of M'Dougal's habits of drunkenness-By Mr Curtis.-He once read the Lord's prayer twice, and the prayer before ' the Grace of our Lord.' It was in tlie evening. He read the prayer, ' Dearly beloved breth ren,' c. Don't you know that there is no prayer, but sentences of Scripture, before that?-That is of no consequence. Mr Parker.-What do you mean by that? Do you say they are of no consequence ? Witness.-No not the prayers. Oh, no. What I said was of no consequence. The prayers are very good. Mr Curtis.-Hoiv dare you say that what you state upon oath is of no consequence?-I mean that what I said was of no consequence to what you said. Do you know the ninth commandment 1-I used to know them all once. Have you never heard the commandment, ' Thoushalt not hear false witness against thy neighbour ?'-Yes. But I made a mistake. I called ' Dearly beloved brethren' a 'rayer, but it bean't a prayer. Tile adults were present, saac Cobb and others were there. The boys and girls laughed when master could not get on better with the prayers. I did not laugh. It was not a subject to laugh at. My daughter did not attend prayers. I attended the boys in to prayers. They are generally read about half-past six, after supper. I can't tell the date or day of the week when tile double readings took place. On reading over the evidence it appeared that the assist ant-commissioner had recorded that the witness had said the sentences before ' Dearly beloved brethren' were of no conse quence. Mr Prendergast denied that the witness had said so. W hat he said was, that having called the address beginning Dearly beloved brethren' a prayer was of no consequence. It was not a prayer for his calling it so. Mr Parker.-No j but he spoke of the sentences before that. Mr Prendergast.-Which was put upon him by Mr iIm' 'l' 0 asked him if he was not a Primitive Methodist. Mr Curtis.-The words 1 of no consequence' came from you. Mr Prendergast.-I beg your pardon. But, if that were M y put them on the witness? I he witness explained that the observation ' That's of no consequence' was meant by him to apply to his having called the address a prayer. i he explanation was not required the man's meaning was clearly enough that bis mistake was 0 consequence, and it was a vile trick, worthy 01 a Mawworm, to pretend that the remark applied to the Scriptural sentences. M' D T al S ay ? r ma y of be fit to be conti-, e , 1I V u 1,°® oe but there cannot be a doubt of yvhat should be done with Mr Parker. For As-Latesi Editios, l sistant Commissioner he has shown himself utterly unlit, but be appears qualified to make a very suit able assistant to Mr M'Dougal. The Poor Law Commissioners have abruptly stopped the inquiry, and made the following mo dest proposals -Poor-Law Commission office, Somerset house, 9th September, ISIS. Sir,-The Poor-law Commissioners have had under consideration the length to which the inquiry at Andover has already extended, and the suspense as well as the outlay to which both parties interested in this inquiry have neces sarily already been exposed. All this must be still further increased if the inquiry is continued in the same form. On these grounds, and because the commissioners wish that some, at least, of the questions now raisedshouid be brought before a jury, they have determined to take the following course -1. The commissioners will cause ati indictment to be preferred against the master in respect of any one case of assault, with an improper intention, alleged to have been committed on a pauper whilst an inmate of the work-house. The commissioners will take any case which you, as the accuser of the master, may suggest, and will cause the bill to he preferred at the next quarter sessions, which take place in the month of October. 2. The commissioners will, in like manner, cause an information before justices to be laid against the master or matron, under section 97 of the Poor-law Amendment Act, for any one act of embezzlement or misapplication of food, clothing, or goods belonging to the union which you may select. It will on this charge be open to any one to show that the inmates have not received their full and proper allow ance of food. It is needless to say that if the master is convicted by a jury on the first of these charges the com missioners would at once dismiss him from office. If he is convicted on the second charge he becomes dis qualified, by the operation of the act, from holding office hereafter. If an indictment for embezzlement or theft he thought more effective, the commissioners have no objection to that form of proceeding, instead of the information under the 97th section above referred to. The commissioners are convinced that this course will at once be the most satisfactory and the most expeditious in bringing the matter to an issue. In order to remove misapprehension the commissioners wish it to be understood that they will cause the indictment to be prepared, and the bill to be preferred, and the infor mation to be laid at the cost of the commission. But they will not undertake to defray out of the funds at their dis posal any subsequent expenses, either for the prosecution or the defence. The parties making the charge can in this, as in every other case, take their own measures to obtain conviction and the master must of course provide for his own defence. The commissioners will also recommend the board of guardians that they suspend the master and matron until the result of the indictment and information are known, and place some other persons in charge of the workhouse. The discretion of doing this is by the regulations of the commissioners vested in the board of guardians. The commissioners can dismiss, but this of course is a step im plying a final decision on the merits of the case, on which no evidence as regards the master is yet before the com missioners, and on which they must be understood as expressing no opinion whatever. Mr Parker, assistant-commissioner, will be directed, on the receipt of a copy of this letter, to suspend all further inquiry until the result of the indictment and information shall be known, since the continuance of such proceedings in the interval might he held to prejudice the case one way or the other. The commissioners request that you will notify to them, as soon as possible, the exact cases which you desire to select, in such a form as to enable the indict ment and the information to be properly prepared forth with. The commissioners have no objection to botli of them being seen by your solicitor before they are finally settled. They also request, with reference to the former, that you will supply them with a list of witnesses necessary in your opinion to support the hill before lie grand jury. 1 am, sir, your most obedient servant, George Coode, Assistant-Secretary. T. C. Westlake, Esq., Andover. And what is to be done with the charges of drun kenness? Nothing. There is not even the decency of a pretence of dealing with them. The alleged immoralities, too, were not confined to assaults with improper intent there were several cases of consent, one confessed and do the Com missioners mean it to be understood that the mas ters of unions are at liberty to make brothels of them, provided they do not use violence ? As the law is notoriously a lottery with many blanks, the proposal to put M'Dougal's guilt or innocence of the many charges against him to the issue of the trial of one case of assault and one ol embezzlement, is the next thing to offering to settle the question by the cast of the dice and the cost of the prosecution, excepting only the expenses of the indictment and information, is to fall on the persons who have endeavoured to apprise the Commissioners of the misconduct of their servant 1 We hope the proposal will be spurned. It is for the Commissioners to investigate the charges against the Master of the Andover Union, and to satisfy themselves whether he is or is not a trust worthy servant. They are not to shuffle off their responsibilities and to transfer them to a jury, and that in the investigation only of one charge while there are more than a score more of the same nature. And suppose the person who has been M'Dougal's accuser should make an inju dicious choice in the selection of a case, and pitch upon one the substantiation of which may be difficult. Have the Commissioners any right to run the hazard, and with it to take the chance of continuing in his place of trust a man who may be guilty of all the rest of the shameful chanjes, or of any of them ? For what are these Commissioners pi id by the public if they are to thrust off their duties upon Mr Westlake and a jury Mr West-lake having to select a solitary case, and a jury to investigate and decide on it? Why is Mr West-lake to perform imperfectly the office of the Com missioners ? If the Board at Somerset house be not compe tent to judge of these charges, or to make its own selection of such as should be submitted to a jury, the sooner it is swept away as useless, or, worse, as the screen to the most shameful abuses, the better. Its whole anxiety seems to be to diminish the chances of discovering the master's guilt, if guilty he be. If it be thought permissible at Somerset house that peculations for amiable domestic purposes should occur in workhouses, that weekly drunken ness should have indulgence, and that unions should be converted into seraglios, let it all be openly avowed and the public assessed to the poor will know how to take their measures to abate the nuisance and imposition for its support. Let us have no false pretences, no mockery of jus tice. Let it be made known whether or not the place of master of a union be peculiarly desirable for debauchees, who may perhaps, with this exam ple, be tempted tp bid for the appointment. The Matron is to be suspended we see, as if there could he any shadow of question as to the impropriety of continuing her in her place, her acts of violence to the witnesses who had given evidence against her husband, having been confessed by her husband's not very scrupulous counsel. THE LAST REPEAL CROl'CHET. Exhorting the Repeal Association to exert them selves strenuously to return seventy Repealers not to sit in Parliament, and who are to be non-repre sentatives, Mr O'Connell remarks-You should in all your official correspondence with the country imitate the Dclenda est Carthago of the Roman statesman-When we had read so far we thought the motto clelenda Carthago not inaptly chosen for the ob ject, the Carthago being the Irish representation, which is to be made a nullity, blotted out of exist ence hut the Irish reading of delenda Carthago is, we find, the very contrary to destructive, it sig nifying Hibernici vitality and regeneration. Mr O'Connell continues the sentence from the place of our interruption of it. with this difference-that instead of suggesting anything destructive, your suggestions will tend to renewed vitality and national regeneration. Politics and singing have of late years become closely connected. France, enraged by the Treaty of July, took her revenge by singing the Marseil laise morning, noon, and night. Europe bore it, and, thank heaven, we have passed through that tuneful crisis. Mr O'Connell having seen what great things can be done by vocal concert, proposes a duet of the orange and green. His plan for the reconciliation of tunes, hitherto at deadly discord, is thus rea soned-Mr O'Ferrall, of Dungannon, is made to call the tunes played by the Orange band ' party tunes.' Now, there are no such things as ' parly tunes' in the repeal agitation-there is a marked distinction between 'national airs' and party tunes.' Whilst we were struggling for emancipation there were party tunes-tunes intended to convey insult and resistance to the Catholics and their claims. But the Catholics as such have no longer any claims to make the date of party tunes is therefore over. As to the Repealers, no Irish tune can possibly be disagreeable t0 even if it were disagreeable, the Repealers ought cheerfully to concede to brother Irishmen the selection of any airs that pleased themselves. Besides, the ' Boyne Water, for ex ample, is a beautiful air. The southern Repealers have in many places taken it up as a national air, and I hope it wilt soon become general with the Repealers of the not , well as those of the south.

In pity to the Assistant Commissioner it was high time to stop the inquiry into the conduct of worthy Mr M'Dougal, of the Andover Union Work- house. Thirteen days of self‐exposure was quite as much as Mr Parker could bear. His zeal was vast, but his dexterity mean, and wretchedly clumsy were his attempts to screen the accused, to abash the witnesses, and obstruct the discovery of the truth. Under his countenance and encourage- ment, however, the professional licence had full indulgence, and the Counsel for M'Dougal gave a turn of ribaldry and indecency to the examination to the last degree disgusting. Indeed, gross as are the o@ﬀences charged, they are less scandalous, less pernicious, less mischievous in example than the attempts to screen them from detection and punishment, which hold out the promise of impu- nity to every licentious brute who happens to be placed at the head of a workhouse. The principle that has governed the inquiry seems to have been, that paupers were to be supposed incapable of speaking the truth and that if any immorality could be charged against their previous lives, any immorality could be practised towards them with impunity. One woman replied, with point and spirit, upon the attempt to invalidate her evidence on the score of character, that it did not follow that because she had been bad before, the master was to make her sin again against her will. M'Dougal has not had the opportunity of making his defence, and therefore we shall not give any opinion on the host of evidence against him but whatever may be the merits of the case, the par- tiality of the Assistant Commissioner in the inves- tigation of it allows of no dispute, it is as @ﬂagrant as folly and injustice combined could make it. We could quote a score of gross instances, but the ex- ample we give will serve as well as a hundred. A witness was giving evidence of M'Dougal's habits of drunkenness- By Mr Curtis.-He once read the Lord's prayer twice, and the prayer before ' the Grace of our Lord.' It was in t@he evening. He read the prayer, ' Dearly beloved breth- ren,' c. Don't you know that there is no prayer, but sentences of Scripture, before that ?-That is of no consequence. Mr Parker.-What do you mean by that ? Do you say they are of no consequence ? Witness.-No not the prayers. Oh, no. What I said was of no consequence. The prayers are very good. Mr Curtis.-Ho@w dare you say that what you state upon oath is of no consequence?-I mean that what I said was of no consequence to what you said. Do you know the ninth commandment ?-I used to know them all once. Have you never heard the commandment, ' Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour ?'-Yes. But I made a mistake. I called ' Dearly beloved brethren' a prayer, but it bean't a prayer. T@he adults were present. Isaac Cobb and others were there. The boys and girls laughed when master could not get on better with the prayers. I did not laugh. It was not a subject to laugh at. My daughter did not attend prayers. I attended the boys in to prayers. They are generally read about half‐past six, after supper. I can't tell the date or day of the week when t@he double readings took place. On reading over the evidence it appeared that the assist- ant‐commissioner had recorded that the witness had said the sentences before ' Dearly beloved brethren' were of no conse- quence. Mr Prendergast denied that the witness had said so. W@hat he said was, that having called the address beginning ' Dearly beloved brethren' a prayer was of no consequence. It was not a prayer for his calling it so. Mr Parker.-NoNo but he spoke of the sentences before that. Mr Prendergast.-Which was put upon him by ################### him if he was not a Primitive Methodist. Mr Curtis.-The words ' of no consequence' came from you. Mr Prendergast.-I beg your pardon. But, if that were so, why put them on the witness? @The witness explained that the observation ' That's of no consequence' was meant by him to apply to his having called the address a prayer. @The explanation was not required the man's meaning was clearly enough that his mistake was of no consequence, and it was a vile trick, worthy of a Mawworm, to pretend that the remark applied to the Scriptural sentences. M'@Dougal #### @or ma@y not be @ﬁt to be ############################## there cannot be a doubt of @what should be done with Mr Parker. For ############################ Commissioner he has shown himself utterly un@ﬁt, but he appears quali@ﬁed to make a very suit- able assistant to Mr M'Dougal. The Poor Law Commissioners have abruptly stopped the inquiry, and made the following mo- dest proposals - Poor‐Law Commission o@@ﬃce, Somerset house, 9th September, 1845. Sir,-The Poor‐law Commissioners have had under consideration the length to which the inquiry at Andover has already extended, and the suspense as well as the outlay to which both parties interested in this inquiry have neces- sarily already been exposed. All this must be still further increased if the inquiry is continued in the same form. On these grounds, and because the commissioners wish that some, at least, of the questions now raised should be brought before a jury, they have determined to take the following course - 1. The commissioners will cause a@n indictment to be preferred against the master in respect of any one case of assault, with an improper intention, alleged to have been committed on a pauper whilst an inmate of the work- house. The commissioners will take any case which you, as the accuser of the master, may suggest, and will cause the bill to be preferred at the next quarter sessions, which take place in the month of October. 2. The commissioners will, in like manner, cause an information before justices to be laid against the master or matron, under section 97 of the Poor‐law Amendment Act, for any one act of embezzlement or misapplication of food, clothing, or goods belonging to the union which you may select. It will on this charge be open to any one to show that the inmates have not received their full and proper allow- ance of food. It is needless to say that if the master is convicted by a jury on the @ﬁrst of these charges the com- missioners would at once dismiss him from o@@ﬃce. If he is convicted on the second charge he becomes dis- quali@ﬁed, by the operation of the act, from holding o@@ﬃce hereafter. If an indictment for embezzlement or theft be thought more e@ﬀective, the commissioners have no objection to that form of proceeding, instead of the information under the 97th section above referred to. The commissioners are convinced that this course will at once be the most satisfactory and the most expeditious in bringing the matter to an issue. In order to remove misapprehension the commissioners wish it to be understood that they will cause the indictment to be prepared, and the bill to be preferred, and the infor- mation to be laid at the cost of the commission. But they will not undertake to defray out of the funds at their dis- posal any subsequent expenses, either for the prosecution or the defence. The parties making the charge can in this, as in every other case, take their own measures to obtain conviction and the master must of course provide for his own defence. The commissioners will also recommend the board of guardians that they suspend the master and matron until the result of the indictment and information are known, and place some other persons in charge of the workhouse. The discretion of doing this is by the regulations of the commissioners vested in the board of guardians. The commissioners can dismiss, but this of course is a step im- plying a @ﬁnal decision on the merits of the case, on which no evidence as regards the master is yet before the com- missioners, and on which they must be understood as expressing no opinion whatever. Mr Parker, assistant‐commissioner, will be directed, on the receipt of a copy of this letter, to suspend all further inquiry until the result of the indictment and information shall be known, since the continuance of such proceedings in the interval might be held to prejudice the case one way or the other. The commissioners request that you will notify to them, as soon as possible, the exact cases which you desire to select, in such a form as to enable the indict- ment and the information to be properly prepared forth- with. The commissioners have no objection to bot@h of them being seen by your solicitor before they are @ﬁnally settled. They also request, with reference to the former, that you will supply them with a list of witnesses necessary in your opinion to support the bill before the grand jury. I am, sir, your most obedient servant, ############# Assistant‐Secretary. T. C. Westlake, Esq., Andover. And what is to be done with the charges of drun- kenness ? Nothing. There is not even the decency of a pretence of dealing with them. The alleged immoralities, too, were not con@ﬁned to assaults with improper intent there were several cases of consent, one confessed and do the Com- missioners mean it to be understood that the mas- ters of unions are at liberty to make brothels of them, provided they do not use violence ? As the law is notoriously a lottery with many blanks, the proposal to put M'Dougal's guilt or innocence of the many charges against him to the issue of the trial of one case of assault and one of embezzlement, is the next thing to o@ﬀering to settle the question by the cast of the dice and the cost of the prosecution, excepting only the expenses of the indictment and information, is to fall on the persons who have endeavoured to apprise the Commissioners of the misconduct of their servant ! We hope the proposal will be spurned. It is for the Commissioners to investigate the charges against the Master of the Andover Union, and to satisfy themselves whether he is or is not a trust- worthy servant. They are not to shu@fﬂe o@ﬀ their responsibilities and to transfer them to a jury, and that in the investigation only of one charge while there are more than a score more of the same nature. And suppose the person who has been M'Dougal's accuser should make an inju- dicious choice in the selection of a case, and pitch upon one the substantiation of which may be di@@ﬃcult. Have the Commissioners any right to run the hazard, and with it to take the chance of continuing in his place of trust a man who may be guilty of all the rest of the shameful charges, or of any of them ? For what are these Commissioners p@aid by the public if they are to thrust o@ﬀ their duties upon Mr Westlake and a jury Mr West- lake having to select a solitary case, and a jury to investigate and decide on it ? Why is Mr West- lake to perform imperfectly the o@@ﬃce of the Com- missioners ? If the Board at Somerset house be not compe- tent to judge of these charges, or to make its own selection of such as should be submitted to a jury, the sooner it is swept away as useless, or, worse, as the screen to the most shameful abuses, the better. Its whole anxiety seems to be to diminish the chances of discovering the master's guilt, if guilty he be. If it be thought permissible at Somerset house that peculations for amiable domestic purposes should occur in workhouses, that weekly drunken- ness should have indulgence, and that unions should be converted into seraglios, let it all be openly avowed and the public assessed to the poor will know how to take their measures to abate the nuisance and imposition for its support. Let us have no false pretences, no mockery of jus- tice. Let it be made known whether or not the place of master of a union be peculiarly desirable for debauchees, who may perhaps, with this exam- ple, be tempted to bid for the appointment. The Matron is to be suspended we see, as if there could be any shadow of question as to the impropriety of continuing her in her place, her acts of violence to the witnesses who had given evidence against her husband, having been confessed by her husband's not very scrupulous counsel. THE LAST REPEAL CRO@TCHET. Exhorting the Repeal Association to exert them- selves strenuously to return seventy Repealers not to sit in Parliament, and who are to be non‐repre- sentatives, Mr O'Connell remarks- You should in all your o@@ﬃcial correspondence with the country imitate the Delenda est Carthago of the Roman statesman- When we had read so far we thought the motto @delenda Carthago not inaptly chosen for the ob- ject, the Carthago being the Irish representation, which is to be made a nullity, blotted out of exist- ence but the Irish reading of delenda Carthago is, we @ﬁnd, the very contrary to destructive, it sig- nifying Hibernicè vitality and regeneration. Mr O'Connell continues the sentence from the place of our interruption of it. with this di@ﬀerence-that instead of suggesting anything destructive, your suggestions will tend to renewed vitality and national regeneration. Politics and singing have of late years become closely connected. France, enraged by the Treaty of July, took her revenge by singing the Marseil- laise morning, noon, and night. Europe bore it, and, thank heaven, we have passed through that tuneful crisis. Mr O'Connell having seen what great things can be done by vocal concert, proposes a duet of the orange and green. His plan for the reconciliation of tunes, hitherto at deadly discord, is thus rea- soned- Mr O'Ferrall, of Dungannon, is made to call the tunes played by the Orange band ' party tunes.' Now, there are no such things as ' party tunes' in the repeal agitation-there is a marked distinction between ' national airs' and ' party tunes.' Whilst we were struggling for emancipation there were party tunes-tunes intended to convey insult and resistance to the Catholics and their claims. But the Catholics as such have no longer any claims to make the date of party tunes is therefore over. As to the Repealers, no Irish tune can possibly be disagreeable ####### if it were disagreeable, the Repealers ought cheerfully to concede to brother Irishmen the selection of any airs that pleased themselves. Besides, the ' Boyne Water,' for ex- ample, is a beautiful air. The southern Repealers have in many places taken it up as a national air, and I hope it will soon become general with the Repealers of the north, as well as those of the south. Let the Repeal wardens com- municate to such Catholics as are not Repealers our earnest advice to listen cheerfully and merrily to ######## Orangemen may play, an@d thus to ######################### of harmony, #################
