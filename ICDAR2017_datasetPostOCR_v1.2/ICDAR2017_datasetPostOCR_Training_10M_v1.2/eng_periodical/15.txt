Corn n fallen in price, so that the labourer has paid sixpence and ninepence a stone for his flour less than he has done within these last four or five years, and yet his wages have been lowered in consequence. And why so ? Because ,i,e Quantity of produce was so much greater than usual lue j r e ,1.. Mw nnw. as the not that the farmer does not complain of the low price, as the Quantity has compensated him for it, he having been at no extra expense in raising it. Here, then, we come to the point, f have estimated the loss of the farmers in this county alone by the game and vermin to amount to 303,7M per annum. Does it not at once show that, could this loss be prevented, the farmer would raise a greater cropland .hat, without injury to him, the price of corn would be lowered for the benefit of the agricultural labourer? I have also asserted that this preservation of game prevents his finding sufficient employment. It is clear that if the Quantity of land at present in tillage is not sufficient, that if more land was under the plough, the agricultural labourer would obtain that employment which he requires. How far I am correct in assuming that we have 128,156 acres of land in plantation and wood in this county, it is impossible for me to say but I can only point out that at four men to the one hundred acres, it would, if in tillage, give employ ment and support to more than five thousand families. I trust you will admit that I have made out a strong case that is, provided that I am not much out in the approxima tions I have been compelled to resort to in making my cal culations. As to the extent of injury done by the game and vermin, on that point I am certain that I am correct. Legislators talk of taking the waste lands into cultivation. Jt appears to me that the preserves are the waste lands. And now then, let us examine into the objections which would be raised. The first observation would be, that you would destroy all the game in the county. I deny it that there would not be so much game of all kinds for sale in the markets is certain. You would have more partrid Hs and fewer phea sants, for partridges can and do thrive where there are no plantations and although there would no longer be long accounts in the newspapers of battues in which 1,000 of pheasantsand hares have been destroyed in one day's shoot ing, there would still be quite enough for sport, although not for slaughter and sale. The price of game would rise, but that would be of little consequence those who will give 10s. a quart for green peas would not suffer much by paying a little dearer for their second course. It will be said that the lands which have been planted are bad lands, unfit for tillage. This is not always the case, indeed very often the contrary but admitting that they were bad land at the time of their being planted, it is well known that after thirty years the deposition of new soil from the decayed vegetable matter will make the worst land good and fit for tillage in deed, planting is the most effectual method of recovering bad land. Some will assert that we shall have no timber left in the country. This is an idle fear. The destruction of the plantations and preserves does not necessitate the destruction of the timber, which, if fine, may always be lelt sufficient for a growing crop, and in such case they will re main as pasture lands, and as such will yield both profit and employment. It may be objected that gentlemen will no longer go down to their estates in the shooting months. Why they should not, if they are fond of the sport, I can not see as surely the shooting in former times was much more rational than the absurd battues of the present day, when it cannot be an amusement. I may here observe that I have often heard it asserted as very advantageous to the country that the landlords should visit their estates, but I must say that, although some advantage may be de rived by the butchers, bakers, and shopkeepers, none what ever accrues to the agricultural population. Is one poor man more employed in consequence of the landlord's coming down to his estate ? Certainly not it is to the farmer, and the farmer alone, that the labourer looks for employ ment. I have often thought, if measures were taken so as to make the preservation of game to its present extent too onerous for the landlords and give them a fair excuse for returning a large portion of their plantations into till age, that although they might cry out, in their hearts they would be very glad if such measures were taken. Their pride will not allow them to take such steps at present but give them an excuse, and but too many would gladly avail themselves of such opportunity of getting rid of the expense of keepers, c., and, at the same time, adding hundreds, and even thousands, to their incomes by returning their useless and expensive lands to tillage, and receiving rent for them. And how is this to be done ? At present covers and plantations are only assessed when they are felled but if all untilled lands and preserves were assessed at a higher rate than those which are tilled, the effect would be, that if the plantations were still preserved, the tenants and farmers would receive great relief in the payment of rates of every description, or else the lands would be restored to tillage and what with the increased demand for employment in consequence, and the increased produce of the land from the diminution of the game, the agricultural labourer would obtain that relief which everybody admits that he requires, but no one appears to know how to administer. I have in these letters adhered strictly to the cause of the agricultural labourer. I might have entered much more fully into the merits of the case if I had explained many matters between landlord and tenant, of which you appear wholly unacquainted but if what I have already advanced obtains no consideration, it is useless my entering more fully mto the subject. For the present, then, I remain, Yours, c., A Norfolk Farmer. LANDLORDS AND GAME. TO THE EDITOR OF THE EXAMINER. Wardour Castle, Sept. 10th, 1845. Sir, Having this moment seen in your paper of the 6th inst. a letter, headed The Agricultural Labourer, ad dressed to Sir Robert Peel, and signed A Norfolk armer, I trust to the motto which the Examiner ' bears find me space for this reply. Though the letter to which allude gives a flat contradiction to many of the ridiculous assertions put forth by the anti-Game-Law men, yet still t iere is so much fallacy in it on some points, combined with an assumed importance by the position in which it appears, that, spite of its anonymous character, it deserves notice. I I he N orfolk t armer states most erroneously that the landlords assert that they must sell their game to put down poaching. Now the landlords, as a body, have never asserted any such thing. As a body, they were strenuously opposed to the sale of game, ever denied that its sale would have any beneficial effect in decreasing the crime, and at this hour they would gladly exchange the power of sale to get back again the old protective qualification in regard to the right to kill. It was the anti-Game-Law men who forced the private property in game upon the landlords and the public and there is not the shadow of fairness, there fore, in blaming the game-preserver for making use of a miserable right, thrust upon him for losses which he deemed and still deems irreparable. It was the anti-Game-Law man that told the landed proprietor, that when game was made an article of general consumption and sale, the poacher would be driven from the market. The proprietor replied, that the sale of game would increase the crime sevenfold, and it has done The public right to the game and wild animals on the farm is at present vested in the tenant the landlord is obliged to make a private covenant with his tenant to secure the privilege of the game to himself. If a tenant, then, is injured by game or wild animals, it is with his own consent, and by virtue of his sign manual, for the giving of which he stipulates that he shall sit at a reduced rent, to en able him to face the possible contingency. There is no hardship in this, and it is waste of time, as well as folly, for designing men to assert that there is any error in it what ever, Protecting game and the privacy of property solely by the Trespass Act will not do. To effect each of these objects the law must be made so much more stringent than it is at pre sent, that a dangerous and unconstitutional and summary interference with the liberty of the subject must be given and however much I may be attached to the sports of the field, against such an un-English state of tyrannical inter ference I would ever lift my voice. If private grounds were to be thrown open to the incursions of the idle and disor derly, by the removal of the laws for the protection of game, a stringent Trespass Act must talce the place of those laws which would be a hundredfold more unpopular, be produc tive of more frequent conflicts to the endangerment of life, than the present Game Laws while at the same time not one of the objections urged against the preservation of game would be removed. The supposition of 200 coalheavers, in their begrimed clothes, forcing themselves into the grounds where a fete was given, does not raise the example the Norfolk Farmer seems to desire for a body of men so misconducting them selves would be guilty of a riot, and at once be within the grasp of the policeman and the law. In this letter it is stated that the people argue thus game wanders about so much that it is impossible to know who bred the game, and therefore who is the rightful owner of it. I may be put into prison by Squire A for taking a hare which did not belong to him, although on his land at the time, as it was born and bred on the land of Squire B. Now, of all shallowillustrations that a writer ever put forth, this is the worst for the law having decided that the game is the property of the owner on whose land it is at the mo ment found, at all events the people thus made to argue, by the Norfolk Farmer, must know that at least the game is not theirs, and whichever way they get to gaol, they are rightly punished for stealing that about which there is no mistake, and as to which they have no sort of legal right or claim. The properly in a sheep does not depend upon who bred itand when this writer further urges that the people say, if game is property, why don't you take more care of your property, and not, by leaving it about, put temptation in a poor man's way? he seems, singularly enough, to forget that large flocks of sheep are necessarily left about at times as much as game, and that the laws for the protection of sheep are infinitely more severe than those for the care of game, and that it most assuredly is the spirit of all law to be more jealously severe in its provisions for the protection of property, precisely as, from the nature of that property, it is of necessity liable to be left in wild and easily accessible places. By this the charge of too great severity in the Game Laws is at once satisfactorily an swered. Your correspondent publishes the arguments he says are used on one side, without debating whether they are correct or not, and recommends a vast change in the law, founded on those arguments and on a clamour which he admits may be fallacious. Such counsel savours but little of education or reason. The making game private property, and legalizing its sale, was a very great error. The manifest inattention to the provisions for regulating its sale was a greater error and last of all, the establishment of a private property, and then not putting that private property on the same footing with all other private property, by surrendering it into a similar custody of police, was a crowning folly, which may well be regarded as the parent of much of the clamour now existing. Game is the only property not placed within the custody of the constable. Take the constable's care from any other species of property, and the inroads upon it would far outstrip the theft on game. The watch, the handker chief, the purse, the pocket-book, the sheep, the fowl, the fagot, and the potatoe, unprotected by the police, would send to our gaols and prisons criminals, far outnumbering those sent there by the game, in spite of the alleged incli nation in the heart of man to prey upon fur and feather. The Norfolk Farmer is an excellent aid against the army he himself desires to befriend in the field, and he at once points the danger of breaking in the ice. One step, and then another-the last the nearest to destruction. First, the right of the landlord to the wild animal is assailed, and then the right to plant h!s tree. The mischief is, that you cannot have pheasants without covers. You cannot have an English ship without the English oak. If you give up the tree you resign the vessel if you yield the claim to the game you infringe the private rights of landed property, and you permit the restless man of change and innovation-the man that recommends an unwholesome concession to crime-to put in a wedge to split the wall as well of the poor man's cottage as of the rich man's palace PRACTICAL CHURCH REFORMS No. IV.- The Universities. TO THE EDITOR OF THE EXAMINER. Sir,-Were it the case now as it was in the olden time t hat learning was confined to Clerks almost exclusively' there would appear to be some reason for looking upon the Universities as nursery gardens in particular for the Church but since the general diffusion of know ledge amongst all classes, such a reason no longer holds good. But it is not my present object to enter upon the question of the Universities at large, but simply to regard them as places for the especial training of the Clergy. I should be sorry to set down aught in malice of the Universities, or any other assemblages of my fellow-men but really it is too much when we are generally told, as we sometimes are in Parliament when the privileges, or, as some would call them, the abuses of the Universities ar brought into question-that they are the nursing places of the Church, and therefore procul este profani! The an swer is farcical. It is my happiness to have known many estimable men at the Universities, and everybody knows that men of the very highest attainments have taken their de grees there but what has this to do with their being effec tive places for training the Clergy ? Why, I only state what everybody is aware of who has had any experience at the Universities, that those men who came up to College in my time, with a view to orders, owed their fitness for them, not in consequence of, but in spite of the system they found there that the good remained good and that the unfit, instead of being made better as under a proper discipline they might have been, or else been prevented from pro ceeding further , were only made ten times more the children of hell than they were before. Their University career was looked upon by them as a time for making play whilst they could, knowing that soon they would be obliged to pull in for the rest of their lives on the principle, with some modification, of Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die -let us take our swing now, for in a few years we must be dead to it all! Now, shocking as it is, I declare that I have myself heard something of the kind pleaded as an excuse for temporary indulgence at the Universities by one who is now moreover a most active clergyman! And the system tacitly permits such to take their swing and, consequently, has ruined many a man altogether, in ex ternal circumstances as well as in soul. That colleges, ori ginally founded for poor scholars, should be so defective in discipline as to produce such enormous evils, is a na tional crime and that, at the same time, they should be called alma maters of this branch of the Christian Church is so egregiously ridiculous as to be absolutely incredible, did we not know what people will say and think when they have been accustomed to it. It was only last session that the cold and staid Pre mier-he who so seldom finds out an abuse, or at any rate notices it, unless it is forced upon him-gave it as his opinion that the discipline of our Universities was far from being what it ought to be. He said this with out any reference to their being the training places for the Clergy, but as general institutions for education but if the remark be true of them as such, how much more ap plicable is it to them as nurseries for the Churchy In one sense, indeed, they are nurseries for the Church because Bishops have, with a few exceptions, required an University degree as a qualification for orders, and therefore Clergymen are obliged to go to College and the Universities and the Church become inseparably connected in our minds. And if the system of our Colleges were as it used to be, or as it ought to be if the easy-living Fellows were compelled to be hard-working Tutors, in the true sense of the word not only teachers, but moral guardians and companions of the youth committed to their care and if such discipline were enforced to compel regularity, and all unnecessary expenses not only curtailed but prevented all which things might be done then the qualification of an University degree might safely and wisely be re quired for orders. But even then something else should be demanded of those who are looking forward to the Mi nistry than a mere University degree-some proof of their fitness for orders and that the present system of Testi-. monials, whether from Colleges or individual Clergymen, does not meet this want, is manifest from the numerous cases of clerical delinquency which are constantly occur ring. I will resume this subject, with your permission, on a future occasion. And remain Your most obedient servant, Persona. in fact, you permit him to assault the vaunted blessings of the Englishman's Castle. I remain, your most obedient, Grantley F. Berkeley. RAILWAYS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE EXAMINER, Sir,-If the late rather numerous railway accidents have had the bad effect of causing much sorrow, alarm, and anxiety, they have also set the minds of men at work to discover methods for obviating the like disasters in future and many have been the ingenious suggestions given to the public through the ' Examiner.' I have thought much upon that class of accidents which has arisen from the engine running off the rails and it appears to me that this might in all cases be prevented by a slight additional expense in the construction of locomotives, the nature of which I will endeavour to explain, in the hope that, through the medium of your columns, it may meet the eye of some practical man, and so prove of benefit to the public. I propose that a sub stantial double rail be laid down midway between the pre sent rails, somewhat higher in the middle than the other rails, and flanged as I believe it is called on each side in a slanting direction, in such a manner that a wheel might run on each side of it inclined outwards at about 45 degrees. Also, that the axes of these wheels be firmly fixed to the fore part of the engine. It appears to me that such a con struction would infallibly keep the engine on the line, and thus obviate those fearful accidents which oftentimes result solely from the cause we are considering. The same mode of construction might for further security be applied to the carriages as w'ell as the engine. I know not whether I have succeeded in making myself understood, which it is oftentimes difficult to do in these matters without the aid of diagrams but I enclose my address in case any of your readers should consider the suggestion worthy of further thought. It may very probably have before occurred to some one, or may even have been made public, but I am not aware of such having been the case. IA0MHX. VERY SIMPLE, BUT INGENIOUS.

It is my happiness to have known many estimable men at the Universities, and everybody knows that men of the very highest attainments have taken their de@ grees there but what has this to do with their being effec@ tive places for training the Clergy ? Why, I only state what everybody is aware of who has had any experience at the Universities, that those men who came up to College in my time, with a view to orders, owed their fitness for them, not in consequence of, but in spite of@ the system they found there that the good remained good and that the unfit, instead of being made better as under a proper discipline they might have been, or else been prevented from pro@ ceeding further , were only made ten times more the children of hell than they were before. Their University career was looked upon by them as a time for making play whilst they could, knowing that soon they would be obliged to pull in for the rest of their lives on the principle, with some modification, of Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die -let us take our swing now, for in a few years we must be dead to it all@! Now, shocking as it is, I declare that I have myself heard something of the kind pleaded as an excuse for temporary indulgence at the Universities by one who is now moreover a most active clergyman! And the system tacitly permits such to take their swing and, consequently, has ruined many a man altogether, in ex@ ternal circumstances as well as in soul. That colleges, ori@ ginally founded for poor scholars, should be so defective in discipline as to produce such enormous evils, is a na@ tional crime and that, at the same time, they should be called alma maters of this branch of the Christian Church is so egregiously ridiculous as to be absolutely incredible, did we not know what people will say and think when they have been accustomed to it. It was only last session that the cold and staid Pre@ mier-he who so seldom finds out an abuse, or at any rate notices it, unless it is forced upon him-gave it as his opinion that the discipline of our Universities was far from being what it ought to be. He said this with@ out any reference to their being the training places for the Clergy, but as general institutions for education but if the remark be true of them as such, how much more ap@ plicable is it to them as nurseries for the Churchy In one sense, indeed, they are nurseries for the Church because Bishops have, with a few exceptions, required an University degree as a qualification for orders, and therefore Clergymen are obliged to go to College and the Universities and the Church become inseparably connected in our minds. And if the system of our Colleges were as it used to be, or as it ought to be if the easy-living Fellows were compelled to be hard-working Tutors, in the true sense of the word not only teachers, but moral guardians and companions of the youth committed to their care and if such discipline were enforced to compel regularity, and all unnecessary expenses not only curtailed but prevented all which things might be done then the qualification of an University degree might safely and wisely be re@ quired for orders. But even then something else should be demanded of those who are looking forward to the Mi@ nistry than a mere University degree-some proof of their fitness for orders and that the present system of Testi-. monials, whether from Colleges or individual Clergymen, does not meet this want, is manifest from the numerous cases of clerical delinquency which are constantly occur@ ring. I will resume this subject, with your permission, on a future occasion. And remain Your most obedient servant, Persona. in fact, you permit him to assault the vaunted blessings of the Englishman's Castle. I remain, your most obedient, Grantley F. Berkeley. RAILWAYS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE EXAMINER, Sir,-If the late rather numerous railway accidents have had the bad effect of causing much sorrow, alarm, and anxiety, they have also set the minds of men at work to discover methods for obviating the like disasters in future and many have been the ingenious suggestions given to the public through the ' Examiner.' I have thought much upon that class of accidents which has arisen from the engine running off the rails and it appears to me that this might in all cases be prevented by a slight additional expense in the construction of locomotives, the nature of which I will endeavour to explain, in the hope that, through the medium of your columns, it may meet the eye of some practical man, and so prove of benefit to the public. I propose that a sub@ stantial double rail be laid down midway between the pre@ sent rails, somewhat higher in the middle than the other rails, and flanged as I believe it is called on each side in a slanting direction, in such a manner that a wheel might run on each side of it inclined outwards at about 45 degrees. Also, that the axes of these wheels be firmly fixed to the fore part of the engine. It appears to me that such a con@ struction would infallibly keep the engine on the line, and thus obviate those fearful accidents which oftentimes result solely from the cause we are considering. The same mode of construction might for further security be applied to the carriages as w'ell as the engine. I know not whether I have succeeded in making myself understood, which it is oftentimes difficult to do in these matters without the aid of diagrams but I enclose my address in case any of your readers should consider the suggestion worthy of further thought. It may very probably have before occurred to some one, or may even have been made public, but I am not aware of such having been the case. @IA0MHX. VERY SIMPLE, BUT INGENIOUS.

And why so ? Because @the quantity of produce was so much greater than ############################################ the farmer does not complain of the low price, as the quantity has compensated him for it, he having been at no extra expense in raising it. Here, then, we come to the point. I have estimated the loss of the farmers in this county alone by the game and vermin to amount to 303,750l. per annum. Does it not at once show that, could this loss be prevented, the farmer would raise a greater crop, and that, without injury to him, the price of corn would be lowered for the bene@ﬁt of the agricultural labourer? I have also asserted that this preservation of game prevents his @ﬁnding su@@ﬃcient employment. It is clear that if the quantity of land at present in tillage is not su@@ﬃcient, that if more land was under the plough, the agricultural labourer would obtain that employment which he requires. How far I am correct in assuming that we have 128,156 acres of land in plantation and wood in this county, it is impossible for me to say but I can only point out that at four men to the one hundred acres, it would, if in tillage, give employ- ment and support to more than @ﬁve thousand families. I trust you will admit that I have made out a strong case that is, provided that I am not much out in the approxima- tions I have been compelled to resort to in making my cal- culations. As to the extent of injury done by the game and vermin, on that point I am certain that I am correct. Legislators talk of taking the waste lands into cultivation. It appears to me that the preserves are the waste lands. And now then, let us examine into the objections which would be raised. The @ﬁrst observation would be, that you would destroy all the game in the county. I deny it that there would not be so much game of all kinds for sale in the markets is certain. You would have more partridges and fewer phea- sants, for partridges can and do thrive where there are no plantations and although there would no longer be long accounts in the newspapers of battues in which 1,000 of pheasants and hares have been destroyed in one day's shoot- ing, there would still be quite enough for sport, although not for slaughter and sale. The price of game would rise, but that would be of little consequence those who will give 10s. a quart for green peas would not su@ﬀer much by paying a little dearer for their second course. It will be said that the lands which have been planted are bad lands, un@ﬁt for tillage. This is not always the case, indeed very often the contrary but admitting that they were bad land at the time of their being planted, it is well known that after thirty years the deposition of new soil from the decayed vegetable matter will make the worst land good and @ﬁt for tillage in- deed, planting is the most e@ﬀectual method of recovering bad land. Some will assert that we shall have no timber left in the country. This is an idle fear. The destruction of the plantations and preserves does not necessitate the destruction of the timber, which, if @ﬁne, may always be left su@@ﬃcient for a growing crop, and in such case they will re- main as pasture lands, and as such will yield both pro@ﬁt and employment. It may be objected that gentlemen will no longer go down to their estates in the shooting months. Why they should not, if they are fond of the sport, I can- not see as surely the shooting in former times was much more rational than the absurd battues of the present day, when it cannot be an amusement. I may here observe that I have often heard it asserted as very advantageous to the country that the landlords should visit their estates, but I must say that, although some advantage may be de- rived by the butchers, bakers, and shopkeepers, none what- ever accrues to the agricultural population. Is one poor man more employed in consequence of the landlord's coming down to his estate ? Certainly not it is to the farmer, and the farmer alone, that the labourer looks for employ- ment. I have often thought, if measures were taken so as to make the preservation of game to its present extent too onerous for the landlords and give them a fair excuse for returning a large portion of their plantations into till- age, that although they might cry out, in their hearts they would be very glad if such measures were taken. Their pride will not allow them to take such steps at present but give them an excuse, and but too many would gladly avail themselves of such opportunity of getting rid of the expense of keepers, c., and, at the same time, adding hundreds, and even thousands, to their incomes by returning their useless and expensive lands to tillage, and receiving rent for them. And how is this to be done ? At present covers and plantations are only assessed when they are felled but if all untilled lands and preserves were assessed at a higher rate than those which are tilled, the e@ﬀect would be, that if the plantations were still preserved, the tenants and farmers would receive great relief in the payment of rates of every description, or else the lands would be restored to tillage and what with the increased demand for employment in consequence, and the increased produce of the land from the diminution of the game, the agricultural labourer would obtain that relief which everybody admits that he requires, but no one appears to know how to administer. I have in these letters adhered strictly to the cause of the agricultural labourer. I might have entered much more fully into the merits of the case if I had explained many matters between landlord and tenant, of which you appear wholly unacquainted but if what I have already advanced obtains no consideration, it is useless my entering more fully into the subject. For the present, then, I remain, Yours, C., A ############### LANDLORDS AND GAME. TO THE EDITOR OF THE EXAMINER. Wardour Castle, Sept. 10th, 1845. Sir,-Having this moment seen in your paper of the 6th inst. a letter, headed The Agricultural Labourer, ad- dressed to Sir Robert Peel, and signed A Norfolk Farmer, I trust to the motto which the ' Examiner ' bears to ﬁnd me space for this reply. Though the letter to which I allude gives a @ﬂat contradiction to many of the ridiculous assertions put forth by the anti‐Game‐Law men, yet still t@here is so much fallacy in it on some points, combined with an assumed importance by the position in which it appears, that@ spite of its anonymous character, it deserves notice.@@ @The N@orfolk @Farmer states most erroneously that the landlords assert that they must sell their game to put down poaching. Now the landlords, as a body, have never asserted any such thing. As a body, they were strenuously opposed to the sale of game, ever denied that its sale would have any bene@ﬁcial e@ﬀect in decreasing the crime, and at this hour they would gladly exchange the power of sale to get back again the old protective quali@ﬁcation in regard to the right to kill. It was the anti‐Game‐Law men who forced the private property in game upon the landlords and the public and there is not the shadow of fairness, there- fore, in blaming the game‐preserver for making use of a miserable right, thrust upon him for losses which he deemed and still deems irreparable. It was the anti‐Game‐Law man that told the landed proprietor, that when game was made an article of general consumption and sale, the poacher would be driven from the market. The proprietor replied, that the sale of game would increase the crime sevenfold, and it has done so. The public right to the game and wild animals on the farm is at present vested in the tenant the landlord is obliged to make a private covenant with his tenant to secure the privilege of the game to himself. If a tenant, then, is injured by game or wild animals, it is with his own consent, and by virtue of his sign manual, for the giving of which he stipulates that he shall sit at a reduced rent, to en- able him to face the possible contingency. There is no hardship in this, and it is waste of time, as well as folly, for designing men to assert that there is any error in it what- ever. Protecting game and the privacy of property solely by the Trespass Act will not do. To e@ﬀect each of these objects the law must be made so much more stringent than it is at pre- sent, that a dangerous and unconstitutional and summary interference with the liberty of the subject must be given and however much I may be attached to the sports of the @ﬁeld, against such an un‐English state of tyrannical inter- ference I would ever lift my voice. If private grounds were to be thrown open to the incursions of the idle and disor- derly, by the removal of the laws for the protection of game, a stringent Trespass Act must ta@ke the place of those laws which would be a hundredfold more unpopular, be produc- tive of more frequent con@ﬂicts to the endangerment of life, than the present Game Laws while at the same time not one of the objections urged against the preservation of game would be removed. The supposition of 200 coalheavers, in their begrimed clothes, forcing themselves into the grounds where a fête was given, does not raise the example the Norfolk Farmer seems to desire for a body of men so misconducting them- selves would be guilty of a riot, and at once be within the grasp of the policeman and the law. In this letter it is stated that the people argue thus game wanders about so much that it is impossible to know who bred the game, and therefore who is the rightful owner of it. I may be put into prison by Squire A for taking a hare which did not belong to him, although on his land at the time, as it was born and bred on the land of Squire B. Now, of all shallow illustrations that a writer ever put forth, this is the worst for the law having decided that the game is the property of the owner on whose land it is at the mo- ment found, at all events the people thus made to argue, by the Norfolk Farmer, must know that at least the game is not theirs, and whichever way they get to gaol, they are rightly punished for stealing that about which there is no mistake, and as to which they have no sort of legal right or claim. The property in a sheep does not depend upon who bred it and when this writer further urges that the people say, if game is property, why don't you take more care of your property, and not, by leaving it about, put temptation in a poor man's way ? he seems, singularly enough, to forget that large @ﬂocks of sheep are necessarily left about at times as much as game, and that the laws for the protection of sheep are in@ﬁnitely more severe than those for the care of game, and that it most assuredly is the spirit of all law to be more jealously severe in its provisions for the protection of property, precisely as, from the nature of that property, it is of necessity liable to be left in wild and easily accessible places. By this the charge of too great severity in the Game Laws is at once satisfactorily an- swered. Your correspondent publishes the arguments he says are used on one side, without debating whether they are correct or not, and recommends a vast change in the law, founded on those arguments and on a clamour which he admits may be fallacious. Such counsel savours but little of education or reason. The making game private property, and legalizing its sale, was a very great error. The manifest inattention to the provisions for regulating its sale was a greater error and last of all, the establishment of a private property, and then not putting that private property on the same footing with all other private property, by surrendering it into a similar custody of police, was a crowning folly, which may well be regarded as the patent of much of the clamour now existing. Game is the only property not placed within the custody of the constable. Take the constable's care from any other species of property, and the inroads upon it would far outstrip the theft on game. The watch, the handker- chief, the purse, the pocket‐book, the sheep, the fowl, the fagot, and the potatoe, unprotected by the police, would send to our gaols and prisons criminals, far outnumbering those sent there by the game, in spite of the alleged incli- nation in the heart of man to prey upon fur and feather. The Norfolk Farmer is an excellent aid against the army he himself desires to befriend in the @ﬁeld, and he at once points the danger of breaking in the ice. One step, and then another-the last the nearest to destruction. First, the right of the landlord to the wild animal is assailed, and then the right to plant his tree. The mischief is, that you cannot have pheasants without covers. You cannot have an English ship without the English oak. If you give up the tree you resign the vessel if you yield the claim to the game you infringe the private rights of landed property, and you permit the restless man of change and innovation-the man that recommends an unwholesome concession to crime-to put in a wedge to split the wall as well of the poor man's cottage as of the rich man's ############################################################# THE EDITOR OF THE EXAMINER.
