[OCR_toInput] 588 THE EXAMINER. Sept. 13, as to whether Carpenter had any effects, the police officer said he would, not give 5s. or all he had in the house he had too bed, the family laid on some straw, and that there was a bit of a table in the house. The clerk said a distress warrant must issue, as Caipenter was not present, and if he had not goods to realize the amount, then the officer would return the warrant as such, and his Carpenter's commitment would then be issued. We were informed that Carpenter has two children, and that his wife is in a very far advanced state of pregnancy. POLICE. The Murder of Eliza Grimwood.-George Hill, a private of the C7th Regiment, now in Dublin, was brought up for examination relative to the confession which he had made that he was the murderer of Eliza Grimwood.-Inspector Field, of the London police, who had been sent over to Dublin to take charge of the prisoner, stated that Edward Sudlow, professor of music, Chorlton-on-Medlock, Hanging-ditch, professionally engaged in the orchestra as principal tenor violin, crossing to resume his place in the, orchestra, when the accident occurred, was by some means thrown down, and his left leg received a very serious com pound fracture a little above the ancle. He is in a very precarious condition. Serious Accident to Sir John Mordaunt, Bart.-A very serious accident occurred to Sir John Mordaunt on the 2nd inst., on his estate at Walton, near Warwick. He was out shooting with a party of friends on the above day, when th gun of a gentleman named Mills, which he was trailing along the ground, accidentally went off, and the contents of both barrels lodged in the legs of Sir John, who was at a short distance.

I in his presence to the effect that he was the man who mur dered Eliza Grimwood.-Mr Traill asked the prisoner if he still adhered to the truth of that statement. The pri soner replied that the confession was made when he was under the influence of liquor, being heartily sick and tired of the army, thinking it was the only and best mode to obtain his dismissal. He was now willing to tell the whole truth, and retracted the words he used as to being a mur derer. His object in making the self-accusation arose from his abhorrence to the life of a soldier, and not long before he had suffered six months' imprisonment for an act which he committed in the expectation of getting out of the army.-Inspector Field said that he had ascertained the prisoner was tried in Dublin for stealing a watch, and con victed of the offence, and sentenced to six months' impri sonment. That the prisoner bore a very indifferent cha racter in the regiment, although he was considered a young man of superior attainments, and spoke the French and Italian languages fluently, and that Colonel Bunbury, the commanding officer, had given him every encouragement, and promoted him to the rank of corporal before he had been long in the regiment, but that owing to his misconduct he was again reduced to the ranks.-Mr Traill said that he should remand the prisoner until Inspector Field had made a searching inquiry into his prisoner's habits, where he had been living at the time of the murder of Eliza Grim wood, and other requisite information, in order that the real truth might be ascertained.-The prisoner was then removed from the bar, and will be brought up again this day.

The Robbery on the Great Western Railway.-Charles Maynard, the house agent, was brought up at Guild hall yesterday on the additional charge of bigamy. Har-the effect of an earthquake in shaking the whole district. The accident was occasioned in consequence of some of the workmen having, contrary to the positive instructions of the master, got an underground door placed in some por tion of the colliery, which had the effect of obstructing a current of air. There were happily not more than five men in the pit at the time of the explosion, three of whom were dreadfully scorched they are, however, likely to recover. Accident on the Midland Railway.-An accident happened on the Midland Railway on Friday last, within six miles of Nottingham. At the Long Eaton station there is a slight curve, which prevents a person seeing any great distance either up or down the line, and at the time of the train, which left Derby at ten minutes past nine a.m., nearing the station at Eaton, two horses, drawing an empty cart, happened to be crossing the line from an occu pation road unfortunately the boy having care of the horses could not see the train till it was close upon him, nor could the engineer see the horses, consequently the engine dashed suddenly upon the two horses, forcing the leader into the air as high as the engine chimney, and carrying the other along the line, the gearing being caught by a buffer, for thirty or forty yards, till the engine was stopped. Both animals were killed upon the spot, but happily the passen gers escaped unhurt, and were not aware of any accident having occurred till the train had ceased running. The lad, aged fourteen, on seeing the danger he was in, instantly ran to the hedge-side, and fell into a ditch, and thus pre served himself from injury. Accident on the Brighton Railway.-On Monday morning, as the seven o'clock mixed train from Brighton was approaching the Clayton tunnel slowly, in consequence of the slippery state of the rails from the fog, a pilot engine, proceeding to its usual station at Horley, came up with the train, and struck the last carriage, a third class, which was unhooked from the train.

The com plainant had occasion to absent himself from town for the purpose of superintending the funeral of an aged parent for a few days, and on his return to town he found, from inform ation he had obtained from his domestics, that his wife, who had been infa uated with the prisoner, had packed iniatory step, he had charge of a train of this kind which left Glasgow at eleven o'clock on Wednesday night. The train reached Linlithgow in safety, where one of the trucks was to be left, and for the sake of convenience it was the last in the train. It was in connexion with this particular truck that Macklin lost his life, but as no person saw the accident, the particulars of it cannot be given with certainty. - ... From the position, however, in which the body was found, up every available article on the premises to accompany jj. j s SU pp 0 sed to have occurred as follows -Before the her paramour to Germany.

As the defendant would not, or could not, un derstand English, the evidence was translated to him. He also conversed with the magistrate in German, declaring that he had no knife about him, and that the complainant struck him first with the poker from feelings of jealousy. He displayed considerable warmth in the dock at times, and, looking furiously at Mr Smith, muttered something that was not clearly understood. Failing to produce the required bail for his appearance at the sessions, Mr Jardine committed him to prison. ACCIDENTS, OFFENCES, OCCURRENCES. Fall of a Room at the Philharmonic Insti tute, Manchester.-During the recent musical per formances at the Philharmonic Institute in this town, shortly before the commencement of the second part, after some of the choir had returned to their places on the plat form, a loud crash was heard behind the scenes, and great shrieking, together with the noise of falling bodies. The accident consisted in the giving way of the planks or rafters supporting a dressing room, in which a great num ber of the male chorus were congregated, taking refresh ment. The weight being greater than the beams could support, they gave way, and fifty or sixty persons were at once precipitated to the stage, a fall of about twelve feet. It is wonderful hat an occurrence so alarming should have been attended with so little serious injury. Only one per son wan much hurt, and he was conveyed at once to the Infirmary, to Ji.ive hi injuries examined, Thjs was Mr poor fellow promptly proceeded with the order, but on the engine passing through the tunnel he imprudently jumped on the step, and was literally jammed against the wall. On the engine emerging from the tunnel the unfortunate crea ture was discovered quite dead, having evidently been killed instantaneously. Heroic Conduct on a Railway.-On Thursday week one of the most providential escapes, as regards human life, occurred on the railway connected with the Bishop wearmouth iron works. The iron works in question extend over avast extent of country, and, for the purpose of a speedy transit from one part to the other, railways have been established, one of which is formed on an inclined plane, down which the heavily laden waggons are propelled at a fearful rate. On the morning of the above day, while one of the train of waggons was passing down, two very old women, each being nearly seventy years of age, labour ing under defective sight as well as hearing, got on the line. A few seconds more they both must have inevitably been crushed to death. Their perilous situation was, how ever, witnessed by Mr David Holsgrove, the overlooker of the works, who in an instant dashed forward and seized the two females, whom he threw off the line, and out of the way of danger. Unfortunately the engine at this instant came up, which knocked Mr Holsgrove down, and he was picked up as dead. He was instantly conveyed to one of the buildings in the vicinity, and medical aid was sent for, when, upon examination, it was discovered that he bad sustained several contusions about the head, that both his Suicide in a Brothel.-On the afternoon of Thurs day week an inquest was opened before the deputy-coroner for Middlesex, on.the body of a young man who committed suicide in a house of ill-fame, under somewhat extraordi nary circumstances. A woman of the town, named Harriet Mayne, was the principal witness. She deposed to having met the deceased on the night of Tuesday, the 2nd inst. a! a concert at the Garrick's Head, in Bow street, where she had part of a pint of sherry with him and a friend of his. About three o'clock on Wednesday morning the deceased accompanied her to her lodgings in Aldenham street, and remained in bed till two o'clock on Wednesday afternoon when she invited him to have some breakfast, but he re fused, and said he would rather have a glass of wine. He gave witness half-a-crown to send for a pint of sherry, and on her calling Margaret Bryan, the landlady's daughter to go for it, deceased added, Stay, I will send for some thing else that will do me good. Deceased then asked for a pen and ink, and wrote a prescription in Latin, telling her to send it to some chemist, giving her 2s. to procure it. Margaret Bryan went to the shop of Mr Wakefield, and on her return with the wine, said that Mr Wakefield said he had not got any, and that it was poison. Witness told de ceased, who said, Nonsense, it is no such thing it is only to enliven up low spirits. Send to another doctor. Mar garet Bryan then went to the shop of Mr Rentmore, in Cla rendon square, and brought back a phial about three parts full of stuff smelling like almonds. Deceased was then lying on the sofa in the parlour, and appeared very cheer ful. Witness left him to get her breakfast, leaving the phial and the wine on the table. She returned in about five minutes and, on entering the room, asked deceased how he was. He replied, he felt better, but his stomach began to pain him at that moment he turned over on the sofa and appeared fainting, and made a gurgling noise in the throat. She called for water, and then sent for a doctor. Mr Wakefield came, and said he was dead, and had taken poison.-By the Coroner I had never seen the deceased beforft I had not the slightest idea that he had sent for poison, and I intended to have taken a portion of what he sent for had he left any, as he said it was for low spirits. I should say he was not more than twenty years of age. When alive he appeared of rather sallow complexion, and has dark-brown hair. His dress consists of a black frock coat, black satin waistcoat, lavender-coloured striped trou sers with straps, the whole quite new, a blue striped silk neckerchief, white stockings, yellow kid goves, and short boots, a new hat, maker's name Townend, Cbeapside and Regent street. He had with him a small yellow stick, with the handle much bitten, and his linen was marked G. Oldfield, jun. On his person were found tvo hand kerchiefs, one white muslin, with the name G. Oldfield on it, the other silk a cigar-case, a green purse studded with steel beads and tassle, with 2s. in it, and on his finger a gold ring with a green stone. Deceased did not give witness any other money than for the wine and for the stuff. Margaret Bryan proved having gone with the pre scription first to the shop of Mr Wakefield, and then to that of Mr Rentmore, where she procured the stuff for deceased, and paid Is. 9d. for it, and that she was served by a young man, Mr Rentmore's brother. The witness having identified the prescription, the deputy-coroner said it was in Latin, and was half an ounce hydrocyanic acid, and at the bottom was written for flavouring soups, and it was signed G. O. Mr Wakefield proved that when he was called to see deceased he was quite dead. The deputy-coroner animadverted on any chemist selling so large a quantity of poison to a stranger, and called upon Mr Rentmore for an explanation. Mr Rentmore, jun., who served it, said he understood that the girl who fetched the poison came from the pastrycook in Seymour street, and knowing oil of almonds was used in that trade, he served it. The deputy-coroner said the circumstances of the case were so strange, although there was no reason to believe that the witness Mayne had connived at the de ceased poisoning himself, that he felt it necessary to adjourn the inquiry for further evidence, and to have the body opened. The inquiry was ultimately adjourned till Mon day last, and after the post mortem examination, the body was removed to St Pancras workhouse for iden tification.-On Monday the inquest was resumed. Mrs Emily Oldfield, the wife of Mr Oldfield, rope-maker, Southgate road, Balls pond, Islington, stated that the deceased was her son, and that he was warehouse clerk in the employ of Messrs Warwick and Sons, wholesale druggists, Garlick hill. On the morning of the 2nd inst. he left home for his office, and told witness that he would go with some friends to Gravesend that day. She gave him 8s. 6d., but did not know what other money he had. She never afterwards saw him alive. Her impression was, that he had been drugged in the house in Aldenham street, and then murdered. The coroner assured Mrs Oldfield that both he and the jury were fully convinced, by the evidence given on the first day, that her son had not been drugged. On the contrary, they felt that the circumstance was unfor tunate for all parties, and that every attention had been paid to him. Mr Rentmore, brother and assistant to Mr Rentmore, surgeon, said that he sold to the servant of the house in Aldenham street, half an ounce of the essential oil of almonds in an ounce and a half bottle. He imagined that it was required by a soap-maker or a pastry-cook. It was usual with druggists to sell as much as an ounce of it to persons in those trades. The bottle was not labelled. Mr G. Wakefield, surgeon, examined the body, which gave evidence of the destructive presence of prussic acid, which, no doubt, was the cause of death. The quantity sold de ceased was sufficient to kill four persons. The jury, after half an hour's deliberation, returned a verdict, That George Oldfield, jun., died by taking the essential oil of almonds with his own hands, but that there was no evidenc of his state of mind at the time that he took it. The jury accompanied the verdict with a censure on Mr Rentmore, jun., for having so incautiously sold the poison. Suicide at Sea.-Mr Hall, of the firm of W. J. Hall and Co., of the Custom house quay, waited upon the Lord Mayor at the Mansion house, on Monday, to make a com munication to his lordship relative to the suicide of a gen tleman on his passage from Hull to London, in a steam vessel. It appeared that on last Saturday afternoon, when the William Darley steam vessel was on her passage from Hull to London, a gentleman, best cabin passenger, jumped overboard, near the lower middle buoy, abreast the Shears, and was drowned. The moment Capt, Turner saw the un arms were broken in two places, and also one of his legs, fortunate man in the water he ordered tho engine to h besides other injuries about the body, It is supposed that stopped and reversed, and the boat to be lowered and

He replied, he felt better, but his stomach began to pain him at that moment he turned over on the sofa and appeared fainting, and made a gurgling noise in the throat. She called for water, and then sent for a doctor. Mr Wakefield came, and said he was dead, and had taken poison.-By the Coroner I had never seen the deceased beforft I had not the slightest idea that he had sent for poison, and I intended to have taken a portion of what he sent for had he left any, as he said it was for low spirits. I should say he was not more than twenty years of age. When alive he appeared of rather sallow complexion, and has dark-brown hair. His dress consists of a black frock coat, black satin waistcoat, lavender-coloured striped trou sers with straps, the whole quite new, a blue striped silk neckerchief, white stockings, yellow kid goves, and short boots, a new hat, maker's name Townend, Cbeapside and Regent street. He had with him a small yellow stick, with the handle much bitten, and his linen was marked G. Oldfield, jun. On his person were found tvo hand kerchiefs, one white muslin, with the name G. Oldfield on it, the other silk a cigar-case, a green purse studded with steel beads and tassle, with 2s. in it, and on his finger a gold ring with a green stone. Deceased did not give witness any other money than for the wine and for the stuff. Margaret Bryan proved having gone with the pre scription first to the shop of Mr Wakefield, and then to that of Mr Rentmore, where she procured the stuff for deceased, and paid Is. 9d. for it, and that she was served by a young man, Mr Rentmore's brother. The witness having identified the prescription, the deputy-coroner said it was in Latin, and was half an ounce hydrocyanic acid, and at the bottom was written for flavouring soups, and it was signed G. O. Mr Wakefield proved that when he was called to see deceased he was quite dead. The deputy-coroner animadverted on any chemist selling so large a quantity of poison to a stranger, and called upon Mr Rentmore for an explanation. Mr Rentmore, jun., who served it, said he understood that the girl who fetched the poison came from the pastrycook in Seymour street, and knowing oil of almonds was used in that trade, he served it. The deputy-coroner said the circumstances of the case were so strange, although there was no reason to believe that the witness Mayne had connived at the de ceased poisoning himself, that he felt it necessary to adjourn the inquiry for further evidence, and to have the body opened. The inquiry was ultimately adjourned till Mon day last, and after the post mortem examination, the body was removed to St Pancras workhouse for iden tification.-On Monday the inquest was resumed. Mrs Emily Oldfield, the wife of Mr Oldfield, rope-maker, Southgate road, Balls pond, Islington, stated that the deceased was her son, and that he was warehouse clerk in the employ of Messrs Warwick and Sons, wholesale druggists, Garlick hill. On the morning of the 2nd inst. he left home for his office, and told witness that he would go with some friends to Gravesend that day. She gave him 8s. 6d., but did not know what other money he had. She never afterwards saw him alive. Her impression was, that he had been drugged in the house in Aldenham street, and then murdered. The coroner assured Mrs Oldfield that both he and the jury were fully convinced, by the evidence given on the first day, that her son had not been drugged. On the contrary, they felt that the circumstance was unfor tunate for all parties, and that every attention had been paid to him. Mr Rentmore, brother and assistant to Mr Rentmore, surgeon, said that he sold to the servant of the house in Aldenham street, half an ounce of the essential oil of almonds in an ounce and a half bottle. He imagined that it was required by a soap-maker or a pastry-cook. It was usual with druggists to sell as much as an ounce of it to persons in those trades. The bottle was not labelled. Mr G. Wakefield, surgeon, examined the body, which gave evidence of the destructive presence of prussic acid, which, no doubt, was the cause of death. The quantity sold de ceased was sufficient to kill four persons. The jury, after half an hour's deliberation, returned a verdict, That George Oldfield, jun., died by taking the essential oil of almonds with his own hands, but that there was no evidenc of his state of mind at the time that he took it. The jury accompanied the verdict with a censure on Mr Rentmore, jun., for having so incautiously sold the poison. Suicide at Sea.-Mr Hall, of the firm of W. J. Hall and Co., of the Custom house quay, waited upon the Lord Mayor at the Mansion house, on Monday, to make a com munication to his lordship relative to the suicide of a gen tleman on his passage from Hull to London, in a steam vessel. It appeared that on last Saturday afternoon, when the William Darley steam vessel was on her passage from Hull to London, a gentleman, best cabin passenger, jumped overboard, near the lower middle buoy, abreast the Shears, and was drowned. The moment Capt, Turner saw the un arms were broken in two places, and also one of his legs, fortunate man in the water he ordered tho engine to h besides other injuries about the body, It is supposed that stopped and reversed, and the boat to be lowered and

The clerk said a distress warrant must issue, as Carpenter was not present, and if he had not goods to realize the amount, then the o@@ﬃcer would return the warrant as such, and his Carpenter's commitment would then be issued. We were informed that Carpenter has two children, and that his wife is in a very far advanced state of pregnancy. POLICE. #################################### Hill, a private of the 67th Regiment, now in Dublin, was brought up for examination relative to the confession which he had made that he was the murderer of Eliza Grimwood.-Inspector Field, of the London police, who had been sent over to Dublin to take charge of the prisoner, stated that ####################################################### Hanging-ditch, professionally engaged in the orchestra as principal tenor violin, crossing to resume his place in the@ orchestra, when the accident occurred, was by some means thrown down, and his left leg received a very serious com-pound fracture a little above the ancle. He is in a very precarious condition. ############################################## very serious accident occurred to Sir John Mordaunt on the 2nd inst., on his estate at Walton, near Warwick. He was out shooting with a party of friends on the above day, when the gun of a gentleman named Mills, which he was trailing along the ground, accidentally went o@ﬀ, and the contents of both barrels lodged in the legs of Sir John, who was at a short distance. ############################## the night of the 2nd inst. the inhabitants of the village of Aberdare, who have hardly had su@@ﬃcient time to recover from the excite-ment produced by the late dreadful catastrophe, were thrown into a state of great consternation by an explosion in ########################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################## violent concussion of air consequent upon the explosion #####################################################################################  that he was the man who mur-dered Eliza Grimwood.-Mr Traill asked the prisoner if he still adhered to the truth of that statement. The pri-soner replied that the confession was made when he was under the in@ﬂuence of liquor, being heartily sick and tired of the army, thinking it was the only and best mode to obtain his dismissal. He was now willing to tell the whole truth, and retracted the words he used as to being a mur-derer. His object in making the self-accusation arose from his abhorrence to the life of a soldier, and not long before he had su@ﬀered six months' imprisonment for an act which he committed in the expectation of getting out of the army.-Inspector Field said that he had ascertained the prisoner was tried in Dublin for stealing a watch, and con-victed of the o@ﬀence, and sentenced to six months' impri-sonment. That the prisoner bore a very indi@ﬀerent cha-racter in the regiment, although he was considered a young man of superior attainments, and spoke the French and Italian languages @ﬂuently, and that Colonel Bunbury, the commanding o@@ﬃcer, had given him every encouragement, and promoted him to the rank of corporal before he had been long in the regiment, but that owing to his misconduct he was again reduced to the ranks.-Mr Traill said that he should remand the prisoner until Inspector Field had made a searching inquiry into his prisoner's habits, where he had been living at the time of the murder of Eliza Grim-wood, and other requisite information, in order that the real truth might be ascertained.-The prisoner was then removed from the bar, and will be brought up again this day. THE ################# Saturday last, at Clerken-well, Edmund Thomas Yeakell and Charles Lander, whose cases have been fully detailed, were again brought before Mr Greenwood, and @ﬁnally committed for trial. ################################################# Maynard, the house agent, was brought up at Guild-hall yesterday on the additional charge of bigamy. ############################################################################### andcasioned in consequence of some of the workmen having, contrary to the positive instructions of the master, got an underground door placed in some por-tion of the colliery, which had the e@ﬀect of obstructing a current of air. There were happily not more than @ﬁve men in the pit at the time of the explosion, three of whom were dreadfully scorched they are, however, likely to recover. ################################### accident happened on the Midland Railway on Friday last, within six miles of Nottingham. At the Long Eaton station there is a slight curve, which prevents a person seeing any great distance either up or down the line, and at the time of the train, which left Derby at ten minutes past nine a.m., nearing the station at Eaton, two horses, drawing an empty cart, happened to be crossing the line from an occu-pation road unfortunately the boy having care of the horses could not see the train till it was close upon him, nor could the engineer see the horses, consequently the engine dashed suddenly upon the two horses, forcing the leader into the air as high as the engine chimney, and carrying the other along the line, the gearing being caught by a bu@ﬀer, for thirty or forty yards, till the engine was stopped. Both animals were killed upon the spot, but happily the passen-gers escaped unhurt, and were not aware of any accident having occurred till the train had ceased running. The lad, aged fourteen, on seeing the danger he was in, instantly ran to the hedge-side, and fell into a ditch, and thus pre-served himself from injury. #################################### Monday morning, as the seven o'clock mixed train from Brighton was approaching the Clayton tunnel slowly, in consequence of the slippery state of the rails from the fog, a pilot engine, proceeding to its usual station at Horley, came up with the train, and struck the last carriage, a third class, which was unhooked from the train. The passengers in that carriage ############################################################## so severely and dangerously injured, hopes are entertained of his recovery.

The com-plainant had occasion to absent himself from town for the purpose of superintending the funeral of an aged parent for a few days, and on his return to town he found, from inform-ation he had obtained from his domestics, that his wile, who had been infatuated with the prisoner, had packed ############################################################### Glasgow at eleven o'clock on Wednesday night. The train reached Linlithgow in safety, where one of the trucks was to be left, and for the sake of convenience it was the last in the train.

The ############################## in the greatest state of alarm. Several witnesses con@ﬁrmed this statement by evidence. As the defendant would not, or could not, un-derstand English, the evidence was translated to him. He also conversed with the magistrate in German, declaring that he had no knife about him, and that the complainant struck him @ﬁrst with the poker from feelings of jealousy. He displayed considerable warmth in the dock at times, and, looking furiously at Mr Smith, muttered something that was not clearly understood. Failing to produce the required bail for his appearance at the sessions, Mr Jardine committed him to prison. ACCIDENTS, OFFENCES, OCCURRENCES. ################################################################# the recent musical per-formances at the Philharmonic Institute in this town, shortly before the commencement of the second part, after some of the choir had returned to their places on the plat-form, a loud crash was heard behind the scenes, and great shrieking, together with the noise of falling bodies. The accident consisted in the giving way of the planks or rafters supporting a dressing room, in which a great num-ber of the male chorus were congregated, taking refresh-ment. The weight being greater than the beams could support, they gave way, and @ﬁfty or sixty persons were at once precipitated to the stage, a fall of about twelve feet. It is wonderful that an occurrence so alarming should have been attended with so little serious injury. Only one per-son was much hurt, and he was conveyed at once to the ############# @@have his injuries examined. This was Mr ##################################################### the engine passing through the tunnel he imprudently jumped on the step, and was literally jammed against the wall. On the engine emerging from the tunnel the unfortunate crea-ture was discovered quite dead, having evidently been killed instantaneously. ############################### Thursday week one of the most providential escapes, as regards human life, occurred on the railway connected with the Bishop-wearmouth iron works. The iron works in question extend over a vast extent of country, and, for the purpose of a speedy transit from one part to the other, railways have been established, one of which is formed on an inclined plane, down which the heavily laden waggons are propelled at a fearful rate. On the morning of the above day, while one of the train of waggons was passing down, two very old women, each being nearly seventy years of age, labour-ing under defective sight as well as hearing, got on the line. A few seconds more they both must have inevitably been crushed to death. Their perilous situation was, how-ever, witnessed by Mr David Holsgrove, the overlooker of the works, who in an instant dashed forward and seized the two females, whom he threw o@ﬀ the line, and out of the way of danger. Unfortunately the engine at this instant came up, which knocked Mr Holsgrove down, and he was picked up as dead. He was instantly conveyed to one of the buildings in the vicinity, and medical aid was sent for, when, upon examination, it was discovered that he had sustained several contusions about the head, that both his ################################################################### was opened before the deputy-coroner for Middlesex, on the body of a young man who committed suicide in a house of ill-fame, under somewhat extraordi-nary circumstances. A woman of the town, named Harriet Mayne, was the principal witness. She deposed to having met the deceased on the night of Tuesday, the 2nd inst., at a concert at the Garrick's Head, in Bow street, where she had part of a pint of sherry with him and a friend of his. About three o'clock on Wednesday morning the deceased accompanied her to her lodgings in Aldenham street, and remained in bed till two o'clock on Wednesday afternoon, when she invited him to have some breakfast, but he re-fused, and said he would rather have a glass of wine. He gave witness half-a-crown to send for a pint of sherry, and on her calling Margaret Bryan, the landlady's daughter to go for it, deceased added, Stay, I will send for some-thing else that will do me good. Deceased then asked for a pen and ink, and wrote a prescription in Latin, telling her to send it to some chemist, giving her 2s. to procure it. Margaret Bryan went to the shop of Mr Wake@ﬁeld, and on her return with the wine, said that Mr Wake@ﬁeld said he had not got any, and that it was poison. Witness told de-ceased, who said, Nonsense, it is no such thing it is only to enliven up low spirits. Send to another doctor. Mar garet Bryan then went to the shop of Mr Rentmore, in Cla-rendon square, and brought back a phial about three parts full of stu@ﬀ smelling like almonds. Deceased was then lying on the sofa in the parlour, and appeared very cheer-ful. Witness left him to get her breakfast, leaving the phial and the wine on the table. She returned in about @ﬁve minutes and, on entering the room, asked deceased how he was. He replied, he felt better, but his stomach began to pain him at that moment he turned over on the sofa and appeared fainting, and made a gurgling noise in the throat. She called for water, and then sent for a doctor. Mr Wake@ﬁeld came, and said he was dead, and had taken poison.-By the Coroner I had never seen the deceased before.

He had with him a small yellow stick, with the handle much bitten, and his linen was marked G. Old@ﬁeld, jun. On his person were found two hand-kerchiefs, one white muslin, with the name G. Old@ﬁeld on it, the other silk a cigar-case, a green purse studded with steel beads and tassle, with 2s. in it, and on his @ﬁnger a gold ring with a green stone. Deceased did not give witness any other money than for the wine and for the stu@ﬀ. Margaret Bryan proved having gone with the pre-scription @ﬁrst to the shop of Mr Wake@ﬁeld, and then to that of Mr Rentmore, where she procured the stu@ﬀ for deceased, and paid 1s. 9d. for it, and that she was served by a young man, Mr Rentmore's brother.
