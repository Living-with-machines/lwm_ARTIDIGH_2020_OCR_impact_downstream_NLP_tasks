The Owenites.-The Social Institution in John street, Tottenham-court road, is defunct, like its late prototype in the Blackfriars road. The building changed hands last week. Its members and finances have been slowly dwindling down till they are considerably in debt. The building, which is very commodious, is now turned into a Mechanics' Institution. It may also be men tioned that the Socialists about six years since expended about 30,000 . in buying land and building a hall in Hampshire. Harmony Hall the place w r as called, and the Owenite principles were there carried out to the fullest extent this has failed likewise, and in a few weeks' time all will come under the hammer to pay the loans granted at the commencement of the undertaking. The Awkward Squadron.-It seems the vessels of the Experimental Squadron are dreadful slow coaches. Some of them only go eight miles an hour. We propose that their names be altered to suit their intuitive pow'ers of slowness, for it looks like mockery to call a vessel the Sept. 13, 184 ters transmitted via the Elbe, may be sent paid or ?, s , . , . .. • .

The latter regulation will be found to he a great boon to the receivers in Hanover or Brunswick, the old charge having been half a Prussian dollar, or Is. 6d. British. Transmitted overland, through Holland, Belgium, or France, the rate of postage is not altered. The official declaration of the state of the poll at the Southwark election was made yesterday by the High Bailiff, when Sir W. Molesworth was declared duly elected. Sir Wi liam returned thanks in the same manly, honest strain, that has characterised all his addresses to his present constituents. The other candidates also addressed the electors. The Guardians of the Greenwich Poor-Law Union have resolved to send a deputation to the Poor-Law Commissioners, to urge on them the inexpediency of forming an asylum in that district and to request them to rescind their order relative to Greenwich. The'Nottingham Journal' of yesterday states that the hosiery and lace trades are slowly though almost imperceptibly declining. A strike for an advance of wages of the opera tive cotton spinners employed in about twelve or fifteen factories in Glasgow and the neighbour hood, took place on Tuesday last. The demands of the workmen, requiring an advance of from ten to fifteen per cent., according to the size of the wheels, were eventually agreed to by the masters. The Caledonian Mercury states that Lord Panmure was seized with serious indisposition last week, while at his shooting quarters near the Grampians. Accounts from Ireland represent the disease in the potato crop as prevalent there as in this country . The inauguration of the statue of Jean Bart, the famous sea captain in the time of Lou s XIV, took place at Dunkirk, his native town, on Sunday last, with great ceremony and splendour. The statue, which is of bronze and of colossal size, is erected in the great square of the town. A Madrid paper, the ' Heraldo,' says that the King of Prussia, during the last diplomatic con ference that took place at Stolzenfels, recommended the recognition of Queen Isabella by the Northern Powers. It is said that the King is desirous of establishing commercial relations between Spain and the Zollverein. The ' Hamburg Gazette' says that the province of Konigsberg is greatly alarmed at the high pro tective duties contemplated by the Zollverein. The adoption of such duties would be a death-blow to that province, which is depending solely on agri. culture. The Pacific Steam Company has just concluded a contract with the British Government between Valparaiso and Panama. From the latter place they will cross the isthmus to Chagres, and then be brought to this country by the West India Royal Mail Steam Company's vessels to South ampton. Saturday Night. By the arrival of a vessel at Falmouth from Buenos Ayres, with papers from the River Plate to the 21st of June, we learn that a modification of the Brazilian Cabinet took place on the 26th of May, which it is hoped will prove the forerunner of a more cordial understanding between the Ar gentine and the Imperial Governments than that which has for some time existed. A Privy Council was held to-day at Osborne house, in the Isle of Wight. The members of the Cabinet who attended it left town at half-past eight this morning by a special train on the South Wes tern Railway. Illness of Mr Wakley.-The 'Medical Times' states that Mr Wakley the Coroner for Middlesex, has had an attack of apoplexy, accompanied by paralysis, during his sojourn in the Isle of Skye. We suggest that the Grampus be rechristened the Tor toise, that the Jackal be changed into the Snail, and that the slowest of the lot be appropriately called the Omnibus, or the Chancery Suit. The Monkey steamer might take the name of Prince Joinville, out of compliment to his pamphlet for invading England, for we must say we never knew anything in nautical matters slower than that.-' Punch.' Diseased Potatoes.-The accounts from the country as well as from the continent speak of a disease by which the potatoes are generally affected. In many of the poorer districts of the metropolis potatoes were sold at 2d. for 41b. and 61b. last Saturday. Externally the disease indicates itself by a moss or fungus, producing a decomposition of the farinaceous interior. In the Isle of Wight, where the disease has occurred in its most virulent form, it was most prevalent in those crops which had been planted on wheat land, which had been manured with guano. The use of the diseased potatoes should be avoided. We perceive that Mr Herapath has addressed a letter to the Editor of the ' Bristol Mercury ' on the subject, in which, after describing the nature of the disease, he says that the longer the crop remains in the land the greater the injury will be. He concludes by the recommendation of the following process for preserving the nutritive part of the potato - After washing the roots, let them be rasped fine and thrown into a large tub or other vessel pour a considerable quantity of water, and well agitate and rub the pulp with the hands all the starch or fecula will, from its great weight, fall to the bottom, while the skin and fibrous matter will be carried away by the water wash the starch with one or two more waters, allowing it to fall after each washing spread it upon cloths in a warm room to dry-in this way about 20 or 21 lbs. will be obtained from every 100 lbs. of potatoes, and it contains as much nourishment as the original roots it will keep any length of time, and might be used with flour to make bread, pies, puddings, c., as well as farinaceous spoon meat. This is much better than throw ing away the diseased roots, and will furnish food for tens of thousands who might otherwise want it. Casting of tiie Wellington Statue.-Last Satur day afternoon a number of scientific and literary gentle men witnessed the casting of seventeen tons of metal at the atelier of Mr Wyatt, Dudley grove, Paddington. The bronze casting was for the fore part of the colossal horse intended for the Wellington statue at the west end. The hinder part has already been cast, and is now in progress of being finished. The immense body of metal was occasionally seen through the iron door of a huge furnace it was intensely brilliant and perfectly fluid. A deep run led from the door of the furnace, and conveyed the liquid metal to a large pit wherein the model was deposited. At a given signal an aperture in the front of the furnace was opened, and a hollow noise, like that from a volcano, was heard. The metal then, in a complete state of fusion, glided forth like a stream of lava, hissing and spitting as it went along to the model pit. A thick whitish smoke, like that from burning arsenic, and nearly as mephitic, entirely filled the atelier to the roof, making it dark-a darkness which might be felt below-while the red burning river of metal conti nued to send forth an almost insupportable heat. In about half an hour the whole seventeen tons had run into the pit in a continuous even flow, giving indication that all was right below. It will take five weeks before the mass can be sufficiently fixed and cool-a period of considerable excitement and suspense to the artist. It was curious that the two principal workmen employed on the occasion are Frenchmen, chosen by Mr Wyatt for their knowledge in bronze casting. They are two hearty fel lows, and stirred up the liquid metal with perfect non chalance, apparently heedless about its having originally been cannon taken from the armies of their country, in order to form a statue of Wellington. The National Gallery.-The National Gallery closed for the annual vacation on Thursday, and will not re-open for public inspection till the 27th of October. Arrival of Two Lions.-Two of the finest lions ever imported into this country have arrived within the last few days, on board the ship John Bartlett, Captain Bartlett. It is very rarely that adult lions are imported, and these are truly splendid animals. They were landed on Thursday in St Katharine's Docks, and conveyed to the Royal Surrey Zoological Gardens. These are the second pair of lions deposited in the gardens within the last few weeks, making seven full-grown lions now in this collection. The late Sir Fowell Buxton. -It has been re solved to erect, by public subscription, a monument in Westminster Abbey to the memory of Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton. It is intended to limit the subscription to 21- 2s., that all who have admired the indefatigable zeal of this great man, in his efforts to extinguish the slave trade, may have an opportunity of expressing their respect to his memory. Foremost amongst those who have ex pressed their concurrence in the object are, the Bishop 0 f London and six other prelates, Lord John Russell, Lord Ashley, the Duke of Sutherland, the Marquises of Chol-mondeley and Breadalbane, the Earls of Jermyn and Chichester the late Earl Grey was also a subscriber. Advantage of Railways to the Fisheries The herring fishery is now in full activity on the Northum berland coast. Many boats from Newbiggin, Cresswell Blyth, and other places in Northumberland, are stationed at Cullercoats, from whence nearly one hundred boats sail every evening. Even at Berwick the effect of rail ways is felt, parties being every morning on the sands buying, to send to Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham, and London and one morning recently no less than five tons of herrings were dispatched by railway to those places. Asylums for the Houseless.-By the Poor-Law Act of last year the Commissioners have power to order parishes and unions, in the following places exclusive of Middlesex and the City of London , to be formed into districts, for the purpose of providing and managing asy lums for the temporary relief and setting to work of des titute houseless poor, who are not charged with any offence, and who may apply for relief, or become charge able to the poor rates -Liverpool, Manchester, Bristol, Leeds, and Birmingham. A constable seeing a poor crea ture wandering about may take him to an asylum, where lodging and food are to be provided. Irish Reapers.-A Glasgow paper says the number who passed through that city during last week cannot have been less than 15,000. The average rale of wages is Is. 8d. per day for women, and 2s. for able-bodied men. The late Fire at Quebec-Last Sunday, in accord ance with a pastoral letter from the ecclesiastical authori ties of the diocese of London, addressed to the clergy, sermons were preached in several churches of the metro polis on behalf of the sufferers from the recent fires at Quebec in May and June. Tiie Rival Arch eologists.-Another Archaeologi cal Association met at Winchester on Tuesday. The Marquis of Northampton was in the chair, and a consi derable number of noblemen, clergymen, and gentlemen were present. The Marquis of Northampton opened the proceedings. The Dean of Westminster read a very elo quent and ably drawn up paper on the general objects of the institution. The proceedings of the week were of great local interest. The Experimental Squadron.-The whole of the fleet forming the Experimental Squadron is now lying in the harbour of the Cove of Cork, where its presence excites the greatest interest. It is stated that during the cruise Rear-Admiral Parker was seriously unwell, being for upwards of a fortnight confined to his cabin by illness. Discovery of an Ancient Bible.-A copy of the first complete edition of the English bible, printed by Myles Coverdale, bearing the date 1535, was accidentally discovered, a few days since, in the false bottom of an old oak chest, at Holkham hall, Norfolk, the seat of the Earl of Leicester. There are numerous imperfect copies of this edition of the Holy Scriptures in existence, two being deposited in the Library of the British Museum, one in the Bodleian Library, one in the Cambridge Uni versity Library-in fact, many of our great libraries and public institutions, and many private collections, possess imperfect copies, but the volume just discovered is in every respect perfect. The noble proprietor of Holkham has had the book appropriately bound, and enclosed in an oaken box, and it now graces the shelves of his mag nificent library. Queen's College of Medicine, Birmingham.-At the annual meeting of the governors, held on Wednesday last, the Right Hon. Lord Lyttelton was unanimously elected Principal of the college. The Rev. Dr Warne-ford has signified his intention of placing in the hands of the Rev. Chancellor Law, the Rev. Vaughan Thomas, and William Sands Cox, Esq., the munificent sum of 500 ., to afford facilities to the institution of preliminary education especially available to the sons of the clergy and of the medical profession. A Noble Instance of Integrity.-II. Hunton, of Carlisle, who died in 1840, had, in the year 1822, while carrying on business as a manufacturer, been obliged, under the pressure of the times, to make a composition with his creditors, paying them seven shillings in the pound. He again commenced business, and by assiduous industry was enabled to realise a considerable sum. He died in 1840, and by his will directed that the balance of their accounts should be paid to the whole of his credi tors. This was immediately done by his widow, and on her death, in 1844, it was found that the first provision in Her will was for payment of interest upon those balances from 1822 to the time of death. These pay ments have just been made, amounting to a sum nearly equal to the balances. An instance of conduct so honour able deserves at least to be recorded.-' Cumberland Pacquet.' Punishment of a Seducer in Denmark.-A letter from Copenhagen, of the 24th ult., gives us the follow ing case, showing the laws of Denmark with regard to per sons who seduce innocent girls under promises of mar riage, which they afterwards refuse to perform -In January last M. Laurent Mikkelsen, a blacksmith, and Mademoiselle Oline Frederica Philipsen, a young mantua maker, an orphan, without father or mother, were affianced. In faith of this pledge the poor girl yielded to the importunities of her lover, and became with child by him. As soon as this was made known to the blacksmith he not only rescinded his promise, but would not suffer the girl to enter his doors. Nothing was left for her but, through her guardians, to institute a suit against her deceiver in the proper tribunal, which decreed that he should either perform the marriage contract, or pay, by way of damages, a sum of 2,000 rix dollars banco-about ll,000f. Against this decision Mikkelson appealed, but it was confirmed. Notwithstanding this, he refused either to marry conseque of the K cially ap courts. the 20th a sufficier and findir ducted hii Oline witl altar.

The building changed hands last week. Its members and @ﬁnances have been slowly dwindling down till they .are considerably in debt. The building, which is very commodious, is now turned into a Mechanics' Institution. It may also be men- tioned that the Socialists about six years since expended about .30,000l. in buying land and building a hall in Hampshire.

Transmitted overland, through Holland, Belgium, or France@ the rate of postage is not altered. The o@@ﬃcial declaration of the state of the poll at the Southwark election was made yesterday by the High Baili@ﬀ, when Sir W. Molesworth was declared duly elected. Sir William returned thanks in the same manly, honest strain, that has characterised all his addresses to his present constituents. The other candidates also addressed the electors. The Guardians of the Greenwich Poor‐Law Union have resolved to send a deputation to the Poor‐Law Commissioners, to urge on them the inexpediency of forming an asylum in that district and to request them to rescind their order relative to Greenwich. The ' Nottingham Journal' of yesterday states that the hosiery and lace trades are slowly though almost imperceptibly declining. A strike for an advance of wages of the opera- tive cotton spinners employed in about twelve or @ﬁfteen factories in Glasgow and the neighbour- hood, took place on Tuesday last. The demands of the workmen, requiring an advance of from ten to @ﬁfteen per cent., according to the size of the wheels, were eventually agreed to by the masters. The ' Caledonian Mercury states that Lord Panmure was seized with serious indisposition last week, while at his shooting quarters near the Grampians. Accounts from Ireland represent the disease in the potato crop as prevalent there as in this country@. The inauguration of the statue of Jean Bart, the famous sea captain in the time of Louis XIV, took place at Dunkirk, his native town, on Sunday last, with great ceremony and splendour. The statue, which is of bronze and of colossal size, is erected in the great square of the town. A Madrid paper, the ' Heraldo, ' says that the King of Prussia, during the last diplomatic con- ference that took place at Stolzenfels, recommended the recognition of Queen Isabella by the Northern Powers. It is said that the King is desirous of establishing commercial relations between Spain and the Zollverein. The ' Hamburg Gazette' says that the province of Konigsberg is greatly alarmed at the high pro- tective duties contemplated by the Zollverein. The adoption of such duties would be a death‐blow to that province, which is depending solely on agri- culture. The Paci@ﬁc Steam Company has just concluded a contract with the British Government between Valparaiso and Panama. From the latter place they will cross the isthmus to Chagres, and then be brought to this country by the West India Royal Mail Steam Company's vessels to South- ampton. Saturday Night. By the arrival of a vessel at Falmouth from Buenos Ayres, with papers from the River Plate to the 21st of June, we learn that a modi@ﬁcation of the Brazilian Cabinet took place on the 26th of May, which it is hoped will prove the forerunner of a more cordial understanding between the .Ar- gentine and the Imperial Governments than that which has for some time existed. A Privy Council was held to‐day at Osborne house, in the Isle of Wight. The members of the Cabinet who attended it left town at half‐past eight this morning by a special train on the South Wes- tern Railway. ######################### ' Medical Times ' states that Mr Wakley the Coroner for Middlesex, has had an attack of apoplexy, accompanied by paralysis, during his sojourn in the Isle of ##################################################### Tor- toise, that the Jackal be changed into the Snail, and that the slowest of the lot be appropriately called the Omnibus, or the Chancery Suit. The Monkey steamer might take the name of Prince Joinville, out of compliment to his pamphlet for invading England, for we must say we never knew anything in nautical matters slower than that.-' Punch. ' ###################### accounts from the country as well as from the continent speak of a disease by which the potatoes are generally a@ﬀected. In many of the poorer districts of the metropolis potatoes were sold at 2d. for 4lb. and 6lb. last Saturday. Externally the disease indicates itself by a moss or fungus, producing a decomposition of the farinaceous interior. In the Isle of Wight, where the disease has occurred in its most virulent form, it was most prevalent in those crops which had been planted on wheat land, which had been manured with guano. The use of the diseased potatoes should be avoided. We perceive that Mr Herapath has addressed a letter to the Editor of the ' Bristol Mercury ' on the subject, in which, after describing the nature of the disease, he says that the longer the crop remains in the land the greater the injury will be. He concludes by the recommendation of the following process for preserving the nutritive part of the potato - After washing the roots, let them be rasped @ﬁne and thrown into a large tub or other vessel pour a considerable quantity of water, and well agitate and rub the pulp with the hands all the starch or fecula will, from its great weight, fall to the bottom, while the skin and @ﬁbrous matter will be carried away by the water wash the starch with one or two more waters, allowing it to fall after each washing spread it upon cloths in a warm room to dry-in this way about 20 or 21 lbs. will be obtained from every 100 lbs. of potatoes, and it contains as much nourishment as the original roots it will keep any length of time, and might be used with @ﬂour to make bread, pies, puddings, c., as well as farinaceous spoon meat. This is much better than throw- ing away the diseased roots, and will furnish food for tens of thousands who might otherwise want it. ####################################### Satur- day afternoon a number of scienti@ﬁc and literary gentle- men witnessed the casting of seventeen tons of metal at the atelier of Mr Wyatt, Dudley grove, Paddington. The bronze casting was for the fore part of the colossal horse intended for the Wellington statue at the west end. The hinder part has already been cast, and is now in progress of being @ﬁnished. The immense body of metal was occasionally seen through the iron door of a huge furnace it was intensely brilliant and perfectly @ﬂuid. A deep run led from the door of the furnace, and conveyed the liquid metal to a large pit wherein the model was deposited. At a given signal an aperture in the front of the furnace was opened, and a hollow noise, like that from a volcano, was heard. The metal then, in a complete state of fusion, glided forth like a stream of lava, hissing and spitting as it went along to the model pit. A thick whitish smoke, like that from burning arsenic, and nearly as mephitic, entirely @ﬁlled the atelier to the roof, making it dark-a darkness which might be felt below-while the red burning river of metal conti- nued to send forth an almost insupportable heat. In @bout half an hour the whole seventeen tons had run into the pit in a continuous even @ﬂow, giving indication that all was right below. It will take @ﬁve weeks before the mass can be su@@ﬃciently @ﬁxed and cool-a period of considerable excitement and suspense to the artist. It was curious that the two principal workmen employed on the occasion are Frenchmen, chosen by Mr Wyatt for their knowledge in bronze casting. They are two hearty fel- lows, and stirred up the liquid metal with perfect non- chalance, apparently heedless about its having originally been cannon taken from the armies of their country, in order to form a statue of Wellington. ######################### National Gallery closed for the annual vacation on Thursday, and will not re‐open for public inspection till the 27th of October. ######################### of the @ﬁnest lions ever imported into this country have arrived within the last few days, on board the ship John Bartlett, Captain Bartlett. It is very rarely that adult lions are imported, and these are truly splendid animals. They were landed on Thursday in St Katharine's Docks, and conveyed to the Royal Surrey Zoological Gardens. These are the second pair of lions deposited in the gardens within the last few weeks, making seven full‐grown lions now in this collection. THE ########################### has been re- solved to erect, by public subscription, a monument in Westminster Abbey to the memory of Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton. It is intended to limit the subscription to 2l. 2s., that all who have admired the indefatigable zeal of this great man, in his e@ﬀorts to extinguish the slave trade, may have an opportunity of expressing their respect to his memory. Foremost amongst those who have ex- pressed their concurrence in the object are, the Bishop @of London and six other prelates, Lord John Russell, Lord Ashley, the Duke of Sutherland, the Marquises of Chol- mondeley and Breadalbane, the Earls of Jermyn and Chichester the late Earl Grey was also a subscriber. ########################################## herring @ﬁshery is now in full activity on the Northum- berland coast. Many boats from Newbiggin, Cresswell, Blyth, and other places in Northumberland, are stationed at Cullercoats, from whence nearly one hundred boats sail every evening. Even at Berwick the e@ﬀect of rail- ways is felt, parties being every morning on the sands buying, to send to Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham, and London and one morning recently no less than @ﬁve tons of herrings were dispatched by railway to those places. ############################# the Poor‐Law Act of last year the Commissioners have power to order parishes and unions, in the following places exclusive of Middlesex and the City of London , to be formed into districts, for the purpose of providing and managing asy- lums for the temporary relief and setting to work of des- titute houseless poor, who are not charged with any o@ﬀence, and who may apply for relief, or become charge- able to the poor rates -Liverpool, Manchester, Bristol, Leeds, and Birmingham. A constable seeing a poor crea- ture wandering about may take him to an asylum, where lodging and food are to be provided. ################ Glasgow paper says the number who passed through that city during last week cannot have been less than 15,000. The average rate of wages is 1s. 8d. per day for women, and 2s. for able‐bodied men. ############################ Sunday, in accord- ance with a pastoral letter from the ecclesiastical authori- ties of the diocese of London, addressed to the clergy, sermons were preached in several churches of the metro- polis on behalf of the su@ﬀerers from the recent @ﬁres at Quebec in May and June. ################################## Archaeologi- cal Association met at Winchester on Tuesday. The Marquis of Northampton was in the chair, and a consi- derable number of noblemen, clergymen, and gentlemen were present. The Marquis of Northampton opened the proceedings. The Dean of Westminster read a very elo- quent and ably drawn up paper on the general objects of the institution. The proceedings of the week were of great local interest. ############################## whole of the @ﬂeet forming the Experimental Squadron is now lying in the harbour of the Cove of Cork, where its presence excites the greatest interest. It is stated that during the cruise Rear‐Admiral Parker was seriously unwell, being for upwards of a fortnight con@ﬁned to his cabin by illness. ################################ copy of the @ﬁrst complete edition of the English bible, printed by Myles Cloverdale, bearing the date 1535, was accidentally discovered, a few days since, in the false bottom of an old oak chest, at Holkham hall, Norfolk, the seat of the Earl of Leicester. There are numerous imperfect copies of this edition of the Holy Scriptures in existence, two being deposited in the Library of the British Museum, one in the Bodleian Library, one in the Cambridge Uni- versity Library-in fact, many of our great libraries and public institutions, and many private collections, possess imperfect copies, but the volume just discovered is in every respect perfect. The noble proprietor of Holkham has had the book appropriately bound, and enclosed in an oaken box, and it now graces the shelves of his mag- ni@ﬁcent library. ########################################### the annual meeting of the governors, held on Wednesday last, the Right Hon. Lord Lyttelton was unanimously elected Principal of the college. The Rev. Dr. Warne- ford has signi@ﬁed his intention of placing in the hands of the Rev. Chancellor Law, the Rev. Vaughan Thomas, and William Sands Cox, Esq., the muni@ﬁcent sum of 500l., to a@ﬀord facilities to the institution of preliminary education especially available to the sons of the clergy and of the medical profession. A ################################ Hunton, of Carlisle, who died in 1840, had, in the year 1822, while carrying on business as a manufacturer, been obliged, under the pressure of the times, to make a composition with his creditors, paying them seven shillings in the pound. He again commenced business, and by assiduous industry was enabled to realise a considerable sum. He died in 1840, and by his will directed that the balance of their accounts should be paid to the whole of his credi- tors. This was immediately done by his widow, and on her death, in 1844, it was found that the @ﬁrst provision in her will was for payment of interest upon those balances from 1822 to the time of death. These pay- ments have just been made, amounting to a sum nearly equal to the balances. An instance of conduct so honour able deserves at least to be recorded.-' Cumberland Pacquet.' ##################################### letter from Copenhagen, of the 24th ult., gives us the follow@ing case, showing the laws of Denmark with regard to per- sons who seduce innocent girls under promises of mar- riage, which they afterwards refuse to perform -In January last M. Laurent Mikkelsen, a blacksmith, and Mademoiselle Oline Frederica Philipsen, a young mantua maker, an orphan, without father or mother, were a@@ﬃanced. In faith of this pledge the poor girl yielded to the importunities of her lover, and became with child by him. As soon as this was made known to the blacksmith he not only rescinded his promise, but would not su@ﬀer the girl to enter his doors. Nothing was left for her but, through her guardians, to institute a suit against her deceiver in the proper tribunal, which decreed that he should either perform the marriage contract, or pay, by way of damages, a sum of 2,000 rix dollars banco-about 11,000f. Against this decision Mikkelson appealed, but it was con@ﬁrmed.
