A He LATE Disturbance at Leipsig By accounts from Leipsig of the 1st inst. we learn that the town en joyed tranquillity in appearance, but there was consider able agitation in the public mind. Some apprehensions existed that disturbances might break out on the 4th of September, the anniversary of the festival of the consti tution. The commission of inquiry was pursuing its re searches, but it is not yet known who gave orders to the troops to fire on the people. The report of the Commis sion is looked for with some impatience. The circular of the Minister of the Interior, on popular assemblies, has excited much discontent. It was at Stolzenfels that the King of Prussia agreed with the German Princes, on the representations of Prince Metternich, that energetic mea sures ought to be taken against innovators and political assemblies, as tolerating them longer might be attended with dangerous consequences. The anniversary fete of the constitution was celebrated on the 4th inst. with great rejoicing. Large bodies of men and women passed through the streets as early as five in the morning, sing ing patriotic songs. Later in the day there were public services in the churches, after which the Communal Guards assembled on the Rossplatz, and went through a series of evolutions. They afterwards filed off in front of the Hotel de Ville, on the balcony of which the autho rities showed themselves. Everything passed off with great calmness and propriety. Good News for the Bohemian Jews.-A letter from Vienna states that it is in contemplation to reduce the personal tax paid by the Jews in Bohemia. Disgraceful Proceeding at Cologne. - The German Journal of Frankfort ' publishes a letter from Co logne, of the 3rd inst., stating that some turbulent persons had got up a meeting there on the 2nd, for the purpose of passing a resolution not to accept the present of 3,500 thalers about 560 . , made by Queen Victoria towards the works of the cathedral, and requesting her to give it to the poor Irish or the Anglican church. A commissary of police, accompanied by some gendarmes, however, en tered the place of meeting, and ordered the persons pre sent to disperse before any resolution was come to on the subject under discussion. The injunction was obeyed. Strange Disturbance at Heidelberg. - The Manheim Gazette states that, in the afternoon of Au gust 29, the public tranquillity was disturbed in a strange way at Heidelberg. Some individuals suddenly collected on the Ludwigs Platz, and, placing themselves near the Museum, fired several shots. They then withdrew as quickly as they had come, and when the police arrived every one had disappeared. The Religious Reform in Prussia.-By a Minis terial order Czerski is prohibited from preaching any more in the city of Posen. The President of the Police proceeded to meet him, and prevent his arrival at Posen, whither he was called by a very pressing invitation of the Catholic Christians. Attempt to assassinate the King of Wurtem-burg.-A letter from Friburg of the 5th, in the ' Frank furter Journal,' states that two shots were fired at Meran, in the Tyrol, at the King of Wurtemburg, but fortunately without hitting him. Tip ' Carlsruhe Gazette' makes mention of a report of the same kind. The Jesuits are considered, it says, as the authors of this attack, in con sequence of the King having spoken, when in Switzer land, openly against the influence of that society. His language to Siegwart Muller, the head of the Jesuit party at Lucerne, produced a great sensation. The New Catholic Church of Germany. -De putations of the leaders of Central and South Germany, together with the clergymen, assembled on the 1st of September at Oppenheim for deliberation. According to report the resolution was unanimously adopted, to attend the synod at Stuttgard, which is fixed for the 15th instant, by deputations. Ronge is to be there, and on his return will visit Frankfort, and perform divine service with the Catholic dissenters. Frankfort is to receive in a short time visits from several of the clergymen who have con formed to the new sect. SPAIN. Marriage of the Queen of Spain.-The ' Memo rial Bordelais' has the following The Queen will re turn to Madrid on the 14th of September, and the Cortes are to be convoked for the 10th of October. It seems certain that Queen Isabella will marry Prince Leopold Francis Julius of Saxe Coburg, born 31st January, 1824, younger brother of King Ferdinand of Portugal and cousin to the husband of the Queen of England. France, it appears, will consent to this marriage provided the sister of the Queen marries the Duke de Montpensier, and all Europe is agreeable to an arrangement so long desired by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. It is said that the King of the Belgians has worked hard to secure this re sult. Our Ambassador at London, the Duke de Soto-mayor Spanish Ambassador , appears to have contributed his part to the same end. He has defeated the combina tions of the partisans of the Comte de Trapani and the Comte de Montemolin Prince of Asturias , who presented themselves at first with some chance of success. Death of Balmaseda.-One of the most distin guished Generals of Don Carlos, Balmaseda, died a few days ago at Chagny, in France, where he had fixed his residence for some time past. Attempted Insurrection in Madrid.-The ' Jour nal des Debats' published on Wednesday the following telegraphic despatch, dated Madrid, midnight, on the 5th instant -An attempt at insurrection was made this evening at ten o'clock, but was promptly repressed by the troops. Only one officer was killed. PORTUGAL. The Ministerial Successes.-We have Lisbon dates to the 1st inst. The manager of the late elections, Senor Jose Cabral, wag banqueted in Oporto, in honour of the success of his measures, and made an exposition of his political sentiments. The Queen has been advised to confirm the late expression of the nation's will in favour of the Ministry, by going on a visit to her Minister, An tonio Cabral, to his castle at Thomar. The Count Tojal had gone to Oporto professedly to inspect the Customs and to make some fiscal arrangements the real object of this visit was said to be money arrangements with the capitalists of that city, those of Lisbon having made con ditions for a respite from loans for some months. The elections had drained the treasury. Another such victory, it is to be feared, would be fatal to the foreign creditors. RUSSIA. A Hint soon taken.-Letters from Taganrog, of Aug. 10, announce that Prince Woronzoff, after his expedi tion on Dargo, had resolved to adopt the new warfare a la Pelissier-that of burning the forests which serve as shel ter to the Circassians. Upwards of fifty waggons, laden with turpentine, resin, and other inflammable matters, had left Taganrog for Stavropol. The Russian Navy.-The 'Cologne Gazette' con tains an article declaring that Russia is busy summer and winter in her dockyards at St Petersburg, and that she has lately introduced Paixhan's mortars into her navy. She possesses in the Baltic at present, 1 ship of 120 guns, 3 of 110, 15 of 84, 12 of 74, 30 of 64 to 44, and 120 of less power, amongst which are steamers armed for war. In the Black Sea she has 2 ships of 120 guns, 2 of 110, 12 of 84, 8 of 74, 8 of 60, 10 of 44 and 100 smaller vessels in the Caspian and White Seas. Pardon for the Poles.-Letters from Warsaw of the 22nd ult. announce that the Emperor had issued a decree granting a general pardon, and restoring to their property, which had been confiscated, the following Polish emigrants -Prince Gabriel Mirski, Stanislas Chaynaki, S. Kasperski, A. Koyanowski, the Brothers Mikalowski, K. Nidecki, J.Protowski, P. Winekierski, Z. Wisniewski, L. II offmani, Z. Uzynski. WEST INDIES. Jamaica.-The last accounts from the West Indies state that the railway from Kingston to Port Royal was fully expected to be opened on the 1st of October. Not one of the English labourers had died, which was attri buted to their abstaining entirely from drinking rum. The weather at Jamaica had been exceedingly dry and warm generally throughout the island, and the heat at Kingston very severe. The accounts from the agricul tural districts continue satisfactory with regard to the soil, but great complaints are made of the total cessation of labour, in consequence of the labouring population de voting part of an expected three weeks of indolence to the anniversary of freedom-a serious affair to those parishes in which the present year's crop had been re tarded by the dampness of the earlier portion of the sugar crop. Notwithstanding these disadvantages the crop for the present year even considerably exceeds the average of late years. These holidays, which commenced on the lsUof August, had, as far as they had gone, proceeded without disturbance, and it was expected would be gene rally indulged in nearly the whole time, in no cases less than seven days. Affairs of Hayti.-Port-au-Prince papers to the 3rd of July speak of an engagement having taken place at Cachiman between the insurgents, numbering 1,500 men, and two detachments of Government troops, num bering in the whole only 600 men. The attack lasted four hours, and ended in the total rout of the insurgent body, leaving a considerable number of dead bodies on the field of battle. The Government troops, on their part, suffered a loss of 4 killed and 26 wounded. A de cree, under date of the 10th of July, pronounces perpe tual banishment from Hayti of the following individuals, stated to have taken part with Gen. Herard in his late attempt to invade the Republic, viz. -Rinchere, Leo Herard, Tullus Herard, Merveilleux Herard, Saint Cyr Bourjolly, Joseph Racolier, Favard, Vilmenay, and Roy. HOLLAND. Opening of the New Exchange at Amsterdam. -The ceremony of opening the New Exchange in this city was to take place with great solemnity on Wednesday last. The King and Princes were to be present. TURKEY. Disturbed State or the Empire.-The whole Pachalik of Bagdad is in alarm. Redschid Pacha, the governor of that province, a fanatic Turk, well known for having taken by storm the holy city of Kerbela, has ex pelled Achmed Pacha, the hereditary governor of Suli-manie, from his post, after a desperate action, he having caused a messenger to have his head cut off, whom Reds chid had sent to summon him to appear in person before the governor. Redschid, indeed, appointed a brother of Achmed in his room, but in vain. Arabia is likewise in a complete state of rebellion. The state of Albania and Bosnia is not much better. The orders of the Porte are scarcely attended to in these provinces, and the new sys tem of recruiting cannot be carried into effect there. The Sulina mouth of the Danube has been so choked up with sand, during the whole summer, that no mer chantman has been able to enter. who cannot get away are obliged to compete with the convicts, and thus earn a miserable subsistence in this devoted and degraded colony. Insolvencies are now be come so numerous that they pass unnoticed. Cargo after cargo arrives, and as the idea of credit has become absurd they are sold for immediate cash at a ruinous sacrifice to the London merchant. Money we have none to send you home, and must claim your further indulgence all our misery has been caused by Lord Stanley's absurd policy we were happy, prosperous, and flourishing, before he inundated us with an overwhelming flood of crime and nothing but a speedy alteration of the convict system can relieve us. All our hopes, therefore, rest on our petition to Parliament. BRAZIL. The Treaty with England.-Aceounts from Rio to the 7th of July have been received by way of France. They contradict the report that the previous packet had brought home a treaty between the Brazilian and Eng lish Governments.-' Liverpool Times.' VAN DIEMAN'S LAND. Wretched Condition of the Colony.-The fol lowing is an extract from a letter dated Hobart Town, April 30th, 1845 -Robbery, violence, and indolence, stalk through the land that portion of the free labourers who had the means to leave have already done so, those UNITED STATES. We have received a letter on the subject of Texas and Mexico, which, without desiring here to express an opi nion on the argument it contains, seems to us written in a spirit not undeserving of attention. TO THE EDITOR OF THE EXAMINER. Sir,-I am surprised to observe that the unreasonable tone generally adopted by the journals in this country, in relation to the annexation of Texas, has called forth no re mark on the part of unprejudiced and discerning English men. Annexation is generally pronounced to be a great injury inflicted by the United States Government on Mexico, and just cause for a declaration of war by the latter indeed it is frequently stigmatised as robbery on the part of the United States, and an insult to the civilized world. Observe all these hard names are lavished upon the act of annexa tion, not upon the acknowledgment of the independence of Texas as a State, in the first instance, or the conclusion of treaties of commerce with her nor yet upon the emigra tion of armed Americans into Texas during her struggle for independence. Whatever wrong may have been committed then, and I think it was a great wrong, although one which the Government of the United States would have found it almost impossible to prevent, little was said about it on this side of the water. A few individuals raised their voices to denounce it, but Governments soon got reconciled to a wrong which they thought they could turn to their own profit treaties were made with these very American emi grants loans of money granted and the young Republic was fast rising into favour with European Governments, when it was suddenly discovered that these people had more sympathy with their first cousins in the States than with their tenth cousins in England, and were actually thinking of joining the Union. Negotiations and manceu-vres were now resorted to, to prevent this act of a people acknowledged by England to be free and, these nogotiations failing, the British press opens an attack, from one end of the kingdom to the other, upon the Americans and Texans, and for what ? Not for having broken any compact with England, or done her any wrong not for having made a very foolish arrangement as far as their own interest is concerned, about which much might justly be said but for having cheated and robbed Mexico. The Texans, with whom England was hand and glove, are suddenly discovered to be rebels, and the Americans invaders and robbers, for treating with them upon more favourable terms than Englrnd could do. I saw it gravely questioned the other day, even in your paper, whether England would give up her claim on Texas as -part of Mexico, for the debt due by Mexico to England V' and this after acknowledging the independance of Texas and loaning her money! , . Really this seems to be either very dull or very insincere. I am one of those Americans who consider the act of annexation as a very improper one on the part of the Go vernment of the United States, for various reasons, moral and political. I object to it because it may prolong the existence of slavery because it increases our territory, al ready too large and especially, because it has been brought about by means which I consider unconstitutional but what is all this to Mexico ? If she wished to quarrel with us, it should have been when our Government acknow ledged the national existence of Texas. The Texans, being once established as an independent nation, have certainly a right to negotiate, as well with America as with England and the Americans have a right to negotiate with them, without being branded as robbers for being able to conclude a treaty which England happens to be averse to. I remain, Sir, your very obedient servant, An American. COURT AND ARISTOCRACY. Her Majesty.-The Court are not expected to arrive at the Castle until the end of the month. Friday, the 26th instant, is at present named for the departure of her Majesty from Osborne house. The 'John o'Groat Jour nal ' says- We believe it is now generally understood that it is the intention of our Most Gracious Sovereign to pay a visit to Dunrobin Castle so soon as the extensive improvements now going on shall have been completed. The Royal Family.-The Queen Dowager will leave Bushy Park for Witley on Tuesday next. It is expected that her Majesty's illustrious relatives, the Duchess Ida of Saxe Weimar, with the Princesses Anne and Amelia, will accompany her Majesty. Earl Howe will be in at tendance on the Court. The Duchess of Kent left Gotha on the 8th inst., for Frankfort, where she will stay three days, and then proceed to Brussels. The Duke of Cam bridge, who is travelling under the title of the Earl of Culloden, arrived on Sunday night at Cologne. He pro ceeded next day to the Palace of Rumpenheim, on the road from Frankfort to Wurlzburg. Will of Mrs Lawrence.-The legacies bequeathed by this esteemed lady to private friends, and to religious and charitable institutions, are very numerous, and amount to 145,000 ., all clear of the duty, which is di rected to be paid by the residuary legatee Earl de Grey # Among the legacies are 5,000 . to the Ripon Diocesan Church Building Society 1,000 . to each of the following institutions -the Leeds Infirmary, York County Hos pital, Harrogate Hospital, Ripon Dispensary, and Middle sex Hospital and 20,000 . to each of the two executors, Bowdler, and the Vice-Chancellor, Sir L.

The Royal Family.-The Queen Dowager will leave Bushy Park for Witley on Tuesday next. It is expected that her Majesty's illustrious relatives, the Duchess Ida of Saxe Weimar, with the Princesses Anne and Amelia, will accompany her Majesty. Earl Howe will be in at@ tendance on the Court. The Duchess of Kent left Gotha on the 8th inst., for Frankfort, where she will stay three days, and then proceed to Brussels.

Some apprehensions existed that disturbances might break out on the 4th of September, the anniversary of the festival of the consti- tution. The commission of inquiry was pursuing its re- searches, but it is not yet known who gave orders to the troops to @ﬁre on the people. The report of the Commis- sion is looked for with some impatience. The circular of the Minister of the Interior, on popular assemblies, has excited much discontent. It was at Stolzenfels that the King of Prussia agreed with the German Princes, on the representations of Prince Metternich, that energetic mea- sures ought to be taken against innovators and political assemblies, as tolerating them longer might be attended with dangerous consequences. The anniversary fête of the constitution was celebrated on the 4th inst. with great rejoicing. Large bodies of men and women passed through the streets as early as @ﬁve in the morning, sing- ing patriotic songs. Later in the day there were public services in the churches, after which the Communal Guards assembled on the Rossplatz, and went through a series of evolutions. They afterwards @ﬁled o@ﬀ in front of the Hotel de Ville, on the balcony of which the autho- rities showed themselves. Everything passed o@ﬀ with great calmness and propriety. ################################## letter from Vienna states that it is in contemplation to reduce the personal tax paid by the Jews in Bohemia. ######################################## 'German Journal of Frankfort@' publishes a letter from Co- logne, of the 3rd inst., stating that some turbulent persons had got up a meeting there on the 2nd, for the purpose of passing a resolution not to accept the present of 3,500 thalers about 560l. , made by Queen Victoria towards the works of the cathedral, and requesting her to give it to the poor Irish or the Anglican church. A commissary of police, accompanied by some gendarmes, however, en- tered the place of meeting, and ordered the persons pre- sent to disperse before any resolution was come to on the subject under discussion. The injunction was obeyed. ######################################## 'Manheim Gazette' states that, in the afternoon of Au- gust 29, the public tranquillity was disturbed in a strange way at Heidelberg. Some individuals suddenly collected on the Ludwigs Platz, and, placing themselves near the Museum, @ﬁred several shots. They then withdrew as quickly as they had come, and when the police arrived every one had disappeared. ################################### a Minis- terial order Czerski is prohibited from preaching any more in the city of Posen. The President of the Police proceeded to meet him, and prevent his arrival at Posen, whither he was called by a very pressing invitation of the Catholic Christians. ################################################# letter from Friburg of the 5th, in the ' Frank- furter Journal,' states that two shots were @ﬁred at Meran, in the Tyrol, at the King of Wurtemburg, but fortunately without hitting him. The '@Carlsruhe Gazette' makes mention of a report of the same kind. The Jesuits are considered, it says, as the authors of this attack, in con- sequence of the King having spoken, when in Switzer- land, openly against the in@ﬂuence of that society. His language to Siegwart Muller, the head of the Jesuit party at Lucerne, produced a great sensation. THE ################################### putations of the leaders of Central and South Germany, together with the clergymen, assembled on the 1st of September at Oppenheim for deliberation. According to report the resolution was unanimously adopted, to attend the synod at Stuttgard, which is @ﬁxed for the 15th instant, by deputations. Ronge is to be there, and on his return will visit Frankfort, and perform divine service with the Catholic dissenters. Frankfort is to receive in a short time visits from several of the clergymen who have con- formed to the new sect. SPAIN. ################################### '@Memo- rial Bordelais' has the following - The Queen will re- turn to Madrid on the 14th of September, and the Cortes are to be convoked for the 10th of October. It seems certain that Queen Isabella will marry Prince Leopold Francis Julius of Saxe Coburg, born 31st January, 1824, younger brother of King Ferdinand of Portugal and cousin to the husband of the Queen of England. France, it appears, will consent to this marriage provided the sister of the Queen marries the Duke de Montpensier, and all Europe is agreeable to an arrangement so long desired by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. It is said that the King of the Belgians has worked hard to secure this re- sult. Our Ambassador at London, the Duke de Soto- mayor Spanish Ambassador , appears to have contributed his part to the same end. He has defeated the combina- tions of the partisans of the Comte de Trapani and the Comte de Montemolin Prince of Asturias , who presented themselves at @ﬁrst with some chance of success. ####################### of the most distin- guished Generals of Don Carlos, Balmaseda, died a few days ago at Chagny, in France, where he had @ﬁxed his residence for some time past. ##################################### '@Jour- nal des Debats' published on Wednesday the following telegraphic despatch, dated Madrid, midnight, on the 5th instant - An attempt at insurrection was made this evening at ten o'clock, but was promptly repressed by the troops. Only one o@@ﬃcer was killed. PORTUGAL. ############################# have Lisbon dates to the 1st inst. The manager of the late elections, Senor José Cabral, was banqueted in Oporto, in honour of the success of his measures, and made an exposition of his political sentiments. The Queen has been advised to con@ﬁrm the late expression of the nation's will in favour of the Ministry, by going on a visit to her Minister, An- tonio Cabral, to his castle at Thomar. The Count Tojal had gone to Oporto professedly to inspect the Customs and to make some @ﬁscal arrangements the real object of this visit was said to be money arrangements with the capitalists of that city, those of Lisbon having made con‐ ditions for a respite from loans for some months. The elections had drained the treasury. Another such victory, it is to be feared, would be fatal to the foreign creditors. RUSSIA. A ######################## from Taganrog, of Aug. 10, announce that Prince Woronzo@ﬀ, after his expedi- tion on Dargo, had resolved to adopt the new warfare à la Pelissier-that of burning the forests which serve as shel- ter to the Circassians. Upwards of @ﬁfty waggons, laden with turpentine, resin, and other in@ﬂammable matters, had left Taganrog for Stavropol. THE ################# 'Cologne Gazette' con- tains an article declaring that Russia is busy summer and winter in her dockyards at St Petersburg, and that she has lately introduced Paixhan's mortars into her navy. She possesses in the Baltic at present, 1 ship of 120 guns, 3 of 110, 15 of 84, 12 of 74, 30 of 64 to 44, and 120 of less power, amongst which are steamers armed for war. In the Black Sea she has 2 ships of 120 guns, 2 of 110, 12 of 84, 8 of 74, 8 of 60, 10 of 44 and 100 smaller vessels in the Caspian and White Seas. ############################# from Warsaw of the 22nd ult. announce that the Emperor had issued a decree granting a general pardon, and restoring to their property, which had been con@ﬁscated, the following Polish emigrants -Prince Gabriel Mirski, Stanislas Chaynaki, S. Kasperski, A. Koyanowski, the Brothers Mikalowski, K. Nidecki, J. Protowski, P. Winekierski, Z. Wisniewski, L. @@Hoffmani, Z. Uzynski. WEST INDIES. JAMAICA.-The last accounts from the West Indies state that the railway from Kingston to Port Royal was fully expected to be opened on the 1st of October. Not one of the English labourers had died, which was attri- buted to their abstaining entirely from drinking rum. The weather at Jamaica had been exceedingly dry and warm generally throughout the island, and the heat at Kingston very severe. The accounts from the agricul- tural districts continue satisfactory with regard to the soil, but great complaints are made of the total cessation of labour, in consequence of the labouring population de- voting part of an expected three weeks of indolence to the anniversary of freedom-a serious a@ﬀair to those parishes in which the present year's crop had been re- tarded by the dampness of the earlier portion of the sugar crop. Notwithstanding these disadvantages the crop for the present year even considerably exceeds the average of late years. These holidays, which commenced on the 1st of August, had, as far as they had gone, proceeded without disturbance, and it was expected would be gene- rally indulged in nearly the whole time, in no cases less than seven days. ################################ papers to the 3rd of July speak of an engagement having taken place at Cachiman between the insurgents, numbering 1,500 men, and two detachments of Government troops, num- bering in the whole only 600 men. The attack lasted four hours, and ended in the total rout of the insurgent body, leaving a considerable number of dead bodies on the @ﬁeld of battle. The Government troops, on their part, su@ﬀered a loss of 4 killed and 26 wounded. A de- cree, under date of the 10th of July, pronounces perpe- tual banishment from Hayti of the following individuals, stated to have taken part with Gen. Herard in his late attempt to invade the Republic, viz. -Rinchere, Leo Herard, Tullus Herard, Merveilleux Herard, Saint Cyr Bourjolly, Joseph Racolier, Favard, Vilmenay, and Roy. HOLLAND. ############################################## ceremony of opening the New Exchange in this city was to take place with great solemnity on Wednesday last. The King and Princes were to be present. TURKEY. ################################## whole Pachalik of Bagdad is in alarm. Redschid Pacha, the governor of that province, a fanatic Turk, well known for having taken by storm the holy city of Kerbela, has ex- pelled Achmed Pacha, the hereditary governor of Suli- manie, from his post, after a desperate action, he having caused a messenger to have his head cut o@ﬀ, whom Reds- chid had sent to summon him to appear in person before the governor. Redschid, indeed, appointed a brother of Achmed in his room, but in vain. Arabia is likewise in a complete state of rebellion. The state of Albania and Bosnia is not much better. The orders of the Porte are scarcely attended to in these provinces, and the new sys- tem of recruiting cannot be carried into e@ﬀect there. The Sulina mouth of the Danube has been so choked up with sand, during the whole summer, that no mer- chantman has been able to enter. who cannot get away are obliged to compete with the convicts, and thus earn a miserable subsistence in this devoted and degraded colony. Insolvencies are now be- come so numerous that they pass unnoticed. Cargo after cargo arrives, and as the idea of credit has become absurd, they are sold for immediate cash at a ruinous sacri@ﬁce to the London merchant. Money we have none to send you home, and must claim your further indulgence all our misery has been caused by Lord Stanley's absurd policy we were happy, prosperous, and @ﬂourishing, before he inundated us with an overwhelming @ﬂood of crime and nothing but a speedy alteration of the convict system can relieve us. All our hopes, therefore, rest on our petition to Parliament. ######################################### from Rio to the 7th of July have been received by way of France.

VAN DIEMAN'S LAND. ##################################### fol- lowing is an extract from a letter dated Hobart Town, April 30th, 1845 - Robbery, violence, and indolence, stalk through the land that portion of the free labourers who had the means to leave have already done so, ################################################################ Texas and Mexico, which, without desiring here to express an opi- nion on the argument it contains, seems to us written in a spirit not undeserving of attention. TO THE EDITOR OF THE EXAMINER. Sir,-I am surprised to observe that the unreasonable tone generally adopted by the journals in this country, in relation to the annexation of Texas, has called forth no re- mark on the part of unprejudiced and discerning English- men. Annexation is generally pronounced to be a great injury in@ﬂicted by the United States Government on Mexico, and just cause for a declaration of war by the latter indeed it is frequently stigmatised as robbery on the part of the United States, and an insult to the civilized world. Observe all these hard names are lavished upon the act of annexa- tion, not upon the acknowledgment of the independence of Texas as a State, in the @ﬁrst instance, or the conclusion of treaties of commerce with her nor yet upon the emigra- tion of armed Americans into Texas during her struggle for independence. Whatever wrong may have been committed then, and I think it was a great wrong, although one which the Government of the United States would have found it almost impossible to prevent, little was said about it on this side of the water. A few individuals raised their voices to denounce it, but Governments soon got reconciled to a wrong which they thought they could turn to their own pro@ﬁt treaties were made with these very American emi- grants loans of money granted and the young Republic was fast rising into favour with European Governments, when it was suddenly discovered that these people had more sympathy with their @ﬁrst cousins in the States than with their tenth cousins in England, and were actually thinking of joining the Union. Negotiations and manoeu- vres were now resorted to, to prevent this act of a people acknowledged by England to be free and, these nogotiations failing, the British press opens an attack, from one end of the kingdom to the other, upon the Americans and Texans, and for what ? Not for having broken any compact with England, or done her any wrong not for having made a very foolish arrangement as far as their own interest is concerned, about which much might justly be said but for having cheated and robbed Mexico. The Texans, with whom England was hand and glove, are suddenly discovered to be rebels, and the Americans invaders and robbers, for treating with them upon more favourable terms than Englrnd could do. I saw it gravely questioned the other day, even in your paper, whether England would give up her claim on Texas as @part of Mexico, for the debt due by Mexico to England @? and this after acknowledging the independance of Texas and loaning her money@@@ ! Really this seems to be either very dull or very insincere. I am one of those Americans who consider the act of annexation as a very improper one on the part of the Go- vernment of the United States, for various reasons, moral and political. I object to it because it may prolong the existence of slavery because it increases our territory, al- ready too large and especially, because it has been brought about by means which I consider unconstitutional but what is all this to Mexico ? If she wished to quarrel with us, it should have been when our Government acknow- ledged the national existence of Texas. The Texans, being once established as an independent nation, have certainly a right to negotiate, as well with America as with England and the Americans have a right to negotiate with them, without being branded as robbers for being able to conclude a treaty which England happens to be averse to.
