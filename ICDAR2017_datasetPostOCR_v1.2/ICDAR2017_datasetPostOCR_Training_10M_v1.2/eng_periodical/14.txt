But as the old proverb says, Wilful waste makes woful want and the consequence of all the magnificence of the Commission may be found in this case, example of a class, narrated by the Times-a source of injury or offence. I repeat, let the folly of re senting particular musical tunes be abandoned for ever. We shall see whether Mr O'Connell is more suc cessful in this mode of disposing of signs of offence than Harry of Exeter. As the surplice is an ob noxious symbol of party, let it be worn by all, said the Bishop of Exeter, and it ceases to be the otten-sive sign. Mr O'Connell proposes to dispose of party tunes in the same way, Join in them, and nobody can consider them a source of injury or offence. If this bold project succeed, the duet of the orange and green must surely disso ve the union. What can stand against the Boyne Water sunv by the united voices of Orangemen and Repealers. If France at the same time should renew the singing of the Marseillais the case of England between the cross fire would be desperate indeed. _ , , _ , , It is equally novel and satisfactory to find that Catholics as Catholics have no longer any claim to make, and that therefore they are free to sing with their Protestant brethren. The Protestant Church in Catholic Ireland is then no bar to the union of voices in the Boyne Water. For an old song Ireland compounds for her grievances and, sitting under her established yoke, will take the second part in the old tunes of ascendancy. From these exalted political views Mr O'Con nell suddenly passes to his dogs and their incapa cities. He complains of a total refusal to lie on the part of the scent. As it is not likely that Mr O'Connell would amuse the Repeal Association with matters relating to the noses of his hounds, we must suppose that the passage is allegorical. I never knew weather in which the scent so totally re fuses to lie. Although rising at six o'clock in the morning, while the due so spelt in the Times report is yet heaviYy on the ground, I find the dogs quite unable to hunt-my excellent pack were, for the first time, totally defeated-and curiously enough, it is only by remaining out till four o'clock in the afternoon that the dogs are able to develop their instinct, and to hunt as usual. By the scent we understand the game of Repeal, by the pack the instruments of Mr O'Connell's sport as for the due so heavy, it can only signify the rent, which is beginning to spoil the scent and form the minister ' that the Commissioners are wholly un altogether the conclusion is, that Mr O'Connell is i able to fix a time for making any grant in this case,' the making very sorry work late for very little game. THE BANKRUPT ECCLESIASTICAL COMMISSION. When we learn from the Bishop of Salisbury that the Ecclesiastical Commissioners cannot fulfil The church of St Nicholas is situated in the village of East Grafton, in the parish of Great Bedwin, Wiltshire. It is as pretty a village church as may be seen in England, built in the Norman style, and affording accommodation to live hundred persons its indefatigable minister is de servedly beloved, the attendance of the villagers most re gular, and their pious and well-ordered demeanour on the Sabbath sufficiently touching to melt any heart less obdu rate than that of an Ecclesiastical Commissioner. This church was built upon the understanding that certain sums should be advanced towards its endowment both by the Commissioners and by the patron of the parish in which the church stands. As a condition of the advance on the part of the Commissioners, the patron was called upon to relin quish his right of patronage to St Nicholas, and to suffer it to pass into the hands of the vicar of Great Bedwin. The right was relinquished upon such an understanding. Upon the faith of the Commissioners the present minister under took the cure of the village, and from the moment that he commenced his duties until the present time -a period of nearly two years-not one farthing has he been able to procure from the Commissioners as a return for his services, and as a fulfilment of their own sacred engage ment. His applications for payment have been numerous and respectful. The minister at length, unable to continue in the performance of hi3 duties unless some steps are taken to secure to him the very small stipend upon which he has consented to labour, applies to the Bishop of the diocese, his natural protector, and a Commissioner. What is the Bishop's answer ? We are accused of unfairly representing the Commissioners. Mr Blackburn tells us that they are prosperous and thriving he defies any minister to stand forward and say, ' that aught has failed him of all that has been pledged to him.' He calls upon us to publish a long letter of details to prove the wickedness of our charges. We comply with his request and, having done so, we proceed to give the Bishop's answer to the minister of St Nicholas. t Nothing can be done,' says his Lordship, 'because the Com missioners' affairs are as embarrassed as they can be ! ' De serted by the Bishop-deserted by the Commissioners, who will not even hold out a promise of future payment-dis missed by ' the respected Secretary,' who is directed to in-making very sorry work of it, hunting early and clergyman has recourse to the liberality of the noble patron. - J J Let the noble patron refuse to pay the debt of the Commis-I sioners-and in what respect is he accountable for it ?-and then St Nicholas Church is closed, and its hundreds of members dismissed from its altar. THE SOUTHWARK ELECTION. The election of Sir W. Molesworth by a great their engagements because their affairs are as majority is highly satisfactory, not only as it places embarrassed as they can be, we are reminded of in Parliament a man of superior abilities and attain-that beautiful instance of their discreet manage- ments, and of sound liberal opinions esses to be guided in all glebe house. A thousand pounds was about the things by the book which tells us when one cheek sum' requisite, one half of which, according to rule, is stricken to turn the other-this disciple of Chris-should have been furnished by the clergyman, the other by the Commission. The Commissioners altered the conditions of the sum twice or thrice, raising it each time, and finally fixing it at about 800 . tor the moiety, instead of 500 . The poor clergyman could neither afford the outlay, nor to keep up, with his slender income, the style of house which the Commissioners stipulated for, with library, drawing room, dining room, c., suited to a man of about 1,000 . a year, and which they would have forced on one of 150 . We do not profess to be exact in the figures, but this is the outline of the case. Can we wonder now that a body disposed to be so profuse in its expenditure is reduced to bank ruptcy ? And as Falstaff was not only witty him self, but the cause of wit in others, so this Eccle siastical Commission is .not only bankrupt itself, hut was calculated to be, aud doubtless has been, the cause of bankruptcy in others. Had they induced the clergyman whose case Lord Radnor made known to build the mansion so preposte rously exceeding his means, he would probably by this time have been as insolvent as his dignified misleading superiors in the Commission. There was a curious ingenuity in making the two ends of extravagance meet in the instance referred to the Commissioners insisting on ad vancing more than was necessary to compel the poor clergyman to defray more than he could afford, and entailing the further imprudence of having to keep up a house too large for his very small income. With such an example as this before us we cannot be surprised that the Com missioners' affairs are as much embarrassed as they can be. They have, indeed, shown aptitudes for arriving at the ne plus ultra of mismanage ment. If there had been wanted a body to show people how to live beyond their means and to ruin themselves, one better constituted for the purpose than this Ecclesiastical Commission could not have been appointed. We now see why it is that Bishops are so rich. It was happily preordained that they should be so rich to enable them to bear the management of the Ecclesiastical Commission. When we find fore appointment to experimental squadrons or other commands. The admirals will be put to bed at a certain hour on a fixed night, and from that time an account will be kept of their rest and activity how long they lay in bed, how long they were rising, what period at a stretch they were able to stand on their legs without or with the aid of stick or crutches, how many yards they could see without or with glasses, what sounds, and of what loudnesg, they could hear without or with ear trumpets. There will be stairs as high as those of the companion stairs of a first-rate, and an exact record will be kept of the number of times a dav if any, the admirals can mount them, and of the time occupied in each enterprise. There will also be a promenade the length of a first-rate's quarter deck, and the number of turns the admirals respectively take, if any, and the time occupied, will be noted. A balance will then be struck of the different abilities and infirmities, just as with the points in which ships excel or fail. There are ships that sail ill and lie-to well, and there are admirals that do the same, and one will lie-to for a month or six weeks at a stretch without straining, head to pillow. In the log of the Experimental Hospital such eutries as these will appear -August 15th.-Signal made for admirals to get out of bed, dress, mount and walk the quarter deck, and exercise sight on the fore-top gallant sail. If an admiral in mounting the companion stairs has the misfortune to tumble, the order is, that upon that accident ail shall return to then-berths, and the sleeping order be resumed. On deck, if any admiral's cocked hat be carried away by stress of weather, all ifte to be turned down below, for fear of fresh misadventure, and the experiments cease for that day, nightcaps being resumed. The Admiralty does not mean to insist that admirals shall be able to climb to the deck and walk it, or sit it, or stand it for that matter. It would, indeed, prefer such qualifications, if attain able but if not, and if there be the choice of an ad miral always in bed, and one who is sometimes out of it, the Admiralty will choose the latter. So for an experimental squadron it will not require that the admiral shall be able to see to the bowsprit end without or with glasses but if it has the elec tion of one who can see the fore-top while another can see only as far as the main-top, the Admiralty, cceteris paribus, will prefer the admiral with the superior organs of sight. The admirals in the Experimental Hospital will be allowed respectively the aid of four nurses each, to be divided into watches of the starboard and larboard nurses, and to relieve each other at the usual periods. tian meekness declares that it was Sir W. Moles worth's sarcastic mention of him as Reverend that provoked him to the retaliation of Infidel. It was thus confessedly prompted only by revenge. Un deniably Mr Miall deserves the name of reverend as little as Sir W. Molesworth that of infidel. THE QUEEN AND THE DEER SLAUGHTER. Extract of a letter, dated Gotha, September 1, addressed to a gentleman in London -'This the deer killing was very shocking. The Queen wept. I saw large tears in her eyes and her Majesty tells me that she with difficulty kept the chair during what followed. When the Queen saw the otter hunt in Scotland, the pity that she naturally felt at the death of the animal was counterbalanced by a knowledge, of his propensities, so that it is almost as meritorious to destroy an otter as it is a snake but this was a totally dif ferent case nor is her Majesty yet recovered. For the Prince, tire deer were too numerous, and must be killed. This was the German method and no doubt the reigning Duke will distribute them to his people, who will thank Prince Albert for providing them venison.' -Standard. The deer must be killed, perhaps so sheep must be killed, bullocks must be killed, but that is no reason why the Queen should be taken to the shambles. Her Majesty wept and could hardly keep her seat during the loathsome slaughter, but why was she taken to a scene so shocking to her fee ings? Whose fault was it that she was so paiped ? As for the otter, pity for his death was coun terbalanced by a knowledge of his propensities. The otter's propensities are given him by nature, and they incline his tooth greatly to fish, but could that evil appetite reconcile the Queen to the wor rying of him by the hounds, aud the impaling, which it is so shocking to see even in a picture? And if destroying otters and snakes be so meri torious as the courtly writer asserts, yet the merit may be questioned of destroying either the one or the other by torture. The courtier, so hard on snakes, ought to have more fellow-feeling with crawling creatures. EXPERIMENT BEFORE EXPERIMENT. It is the intention of the Admiralty to establish an infirmary, in which trial may be made of the bodily infirmities and incapacities of admirals be THE AGRICULTURAL LABOURER. Letter V. TO SIR ROBERT PEEL. Sir Robert,-I repeat that I have not exaggerated in asserting that one-tenth of the crops of this country are de stroyed by the game and the vermin protected in the covers. Latterly the system of planting has been different from what it used to be. We used to have preserves of several hundred acres in which the game found shelter, and of course did great damage to the adjacent crops but now we have patches and copses of woodland in every three or four fields, 6mall in size, but sufficient for the shelter and breeding of the game-a sort of pen in which game is folded, ready to consume the produce of every field, so that none should escape. The foxes have been lately all de stroyed, and the country has no longer been hunted as it used to be, although some hounds still are kept. The foxes were the farmers' friends in this county, as they kept down the rabbits but since game has been sold, they have been found to interfere too much with the profits end although no landlord will admit that he has ordered a fox to be killed, it is certain that they have almost wholly dis appeared. Formerly, when game was reared only for sport, foxes were respected, being equally entitled to protection as affording another variety of amusement to others but now that game is a source of profit, that gentlemanly feel ing appears to have been lost. From the want of statistics, it is impossible to say what proportion of the land in the country is at present in plan tation and wood. The total number of acres in Norfolk are stated to be 1,338,880, of whichit is computed that there are in arable, meadow, and marsh, 1,082,567. This leaves a balance of 256,813 acres of land for the sites of towns, roads, plan tations, and waste land. How much of this may be in wood and plantation, it is impossible to say for want of statistics but admitting that there is one-half, we have 128,156 acres of land untilled in this county alone, and that with a popu lation suffering from want of employment. And now let me prove the truth of my assertion, that the preservation of game is very injurious to the agricultural labourer, as in the first place it raises the price of his food. I have before expressed my opinion that whatever benefit might occur to the nation from the free trade in corn, it would not prove of advantage to the agricultural labourer, as with the permanent fall of the price of corn his wages would be lowered in proportion.

Upon the faith of the Commissioners the present minister under-took the cure of the village, and from the moment that he commenced his duties until the present time -a period of nearly two years-not one farthing has he been able to procure from the Commissioners as a return for his services, and as a ful@ﬁlment of their own sacred engage-ment. His applications for payment have been numerous and respectful. The minister at length, unable to continue in the performance of his duties unless some steps are taken to secure to him the very small stipend upon which he has consented to labour, applies to the Bishop of the diocese, his natural protector, and a Commissioner. What is the Bishop's answer@? We are accused of unfairly representing the Commissioners. Mr Blackburn tells us that they are prosperous and thriving he de@ﬁes any minister to stand forward and say, '@that aught has failed him of all that has been pledged to him.' He calls upon us to publish a long letter of details to prove the wickedness of our charges. We comply with his request and, having done so, we proceed to give the Bishop's answer to the minister of St Nicholas. @'Nothing can be done,' says his Lordship, 'because the Com-missioners' a@ﬀairs are as embarrassed as they can be@!@' De-serted by the Bishop-deserted by the Commissioners, who will not even hold out a promise of future payment-dis-missed by '@the respected Secretary,' who is directed to ############################################################ has recourse to the liberality of the noble patron. @@@@@@Let the noble patron refuse to pay the debt of the Commis-@@sioners-and in what respect is he accountable for it@?-and then St Nicholas Church is closed, and its hundreds of members dismissed from its altar.

Molesworth by a great #################################################################################################################################### are reminded of ##################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################### have been furnished by the clergyman, the other by the Commission. The Commissioners altered the conditions of the sum twice or thrice, raising it each time, and @ﬁnally @ﬁxing it at about 800l. for the moiety, instead of 500l. The poor clergyman could neither a@ﬀord the outlay, nor to keep up, with his slender income, the style of house which the Commissioners stipulated for, with library, drawing room, dining room, c., suited to a man of about 1,000l. a year, and which they would have forced on one of 150l. We do not profess to be exact in the @ﬁgures, but this is the outline of the case. Can we wonder now that a body disposed to be so profuse in its expenditure is reduced to bank-ruptcy@? And as Falsta@ﬀ was not only witty him-self, but the cause of wit in others, so this Eccle-siastical Commission is @not only bankrupt itself, but was calculated to be, and doubtless has been, the cause of bankruptcy in others. Had they induced the clergyman whose case Lord Radnor made known to build the mansion so preposte-rously exceeding his means, he would probably by this time have been as insolvent as his digni@ﬁed misleading superiors in the Commission. There was a curious ingenuity in making the two ends of extravagance meet in the instance referred to the Commissioners insisting on ad-vancing more than was necessary to compel the poor clergyman to defray more than he could a@ﬀord, and entailing the further imprudence of having to keep up a house too large for his very small income. With such an example as this before us we cannot be surprised that the Com-missioners' a@ﬀairs are as much embarrassed as they can be. They have, indeed, shown aptitudes for arriving at the ne plus ultra of mismanage-ment. If there had been wanted a body to show people how to live beyond their means and to ruin themselves, one better constituted for the purpose than this Ecclesiastical Commission could not have been appointed. We now see why it is that Bishops are so rich. It was happily preordained that they should be so rich to enable them to bear the management of the Ecclesiastical Commission. When we ############################################### or other commands. The admirals will be put to bed at a certain hour on a @ﬁxed night, and from that time an account will be kept of their rest and activity, how long they lay in bed, how long they were rising, what period at a stretch they were able to stand on their legs without or with the aid of stick or crutches, how many yards they could see without or with glasses, what sounds, and of what loudness, they could hear without or with ear trumpets. There will be stairs as high as those of the companion stairs of a first-rate, and an exact record will be kept of the number of times a day, if any, the admirals can mount them, and of the time occupied in each enterprise. There will also be a promenade the length of a first-rate's quarter deck, and the number of turns the admirals respectively take, if any, and the time occupied, will be noted. A balance will then be struck of the di@ﬀerent abilities and in@ﬁrmities, just as with the points in which ships excel or fail. There are ships that sail ill and lie-to well, and there are admirals that do the same, and one will lie-to for a month or six weeks at a stretch without straining, head to pillow. In the log of the Experimental Hospital such entries as these will appear -August 15th.-Signal made for admirals to get out of bed, dress, mount and walk the quarter deck, and exercise sight on the fore-top gallant sail. If an admiral in mounting the companion stairs has the misfortune to tumble, the order is, that upon that accident all shall return to their berths, and the sleeping order be resumed. On deck, if any admiral's cocked hat be carried away by stress of weather, all @are to be turned down below, for fear of fresh misadventure, and the experiments cease for that day, nightcaps being resumed. The Admiralty does not mean to insist that admirals shall be able to climb to the deck and walk it, or sit it, or stand it for that matter. It would, indeed, prefer such quali@ﬁcations, if attain-able but if not, and if there be the choice of an ad-miral always in bed, and one who is sometimes out of it, the Admiralty will choose the latter. So for an experimental squadron it will not require that the admiral shall be able to see to the bowsprit end without or with glasses but if it has the elec-tion of one who can see the fore-top while another can see only as far as the main-top, the Admiralty, coeteris paribus, will prefer the admiral with the superior organs of sight. The admirals in the Experimental Hospital will be allowed respectively the aid of four nurses each, to be divided into watches of the starboard and larboard nurses, and to relieve each other at the usual ################################################################ sarcastic mention of him as Reverend that provoked him to the retaliation of In@ﬁdel. It was thus confessedly prompted only by revenge. Un-deniably Mr Miall deserves the name of reverend as little as Sir W. Molesworth that of in@ﬁdel. THE QUEEN AND THE DEER SLAUGHTER. Extract of a letter, dated Gotha, September 1, addressed to a gentleman in London -'This the deer killing was very shocking. The Queen wept. I saw large tears in her eyes and her Majesty tells me that she with di@ﬀiculty kept the chair during what followed. When the Queen saw the otter hunt in Scotland, the pity that she naturally felt at the death of the animal was counterbalanced by a knowledge@ of his propensities, so that it is almost as meritorious to destroy an otter as it is a snake but this was a totally dif-ferent case nor is her Majesty yet recovered. For the Prince, t@he deer were too numerous, and must be killed. This was the German method and no doubt the reigning Duke will distribute them to his people, who will thank Prince Albert for providing them venison.' -Standard. The deer must be killed, perhaps so sheep must be killed, bullocks must be killed, but that is no reason why the Queen should be taken to the shambles. Her Majesty wept and could hardly keep her seat during the loathsome slaughter, but why was she taken to a scene so shocking to her feelings? Whose fault was it that she was so pained@? As for the otter, pity for his death was coun-terbalanced by a knowledge of his propensities. The otter's propensities are given him by nature, and they incline his tooth greatly to @ﬁsh, but could that evil appetite reconcile the Queen to the wor-rying of him by the hounds, and the impaling, which it is so shocking to see even in a picture? And if destroying otters and snakes be so meri-torious as the courtly writer asserts, yet the merit may be questioned of destroying either the one or the other by torture. The courtier, so hard on snakes, ought to have more fellow-feeling with crawling creatures. EXPERIMENT BEFORE EXPERIMENT. It is the intention of the Admiralty to establish an in@ﬁrmary, in which trial may be made of the bodily in@ﬁrmities and incapacities of admirals ############################################################### Robert,-I repeat that I have not exaggerated in asserting that one-tenth of the crops of this country are de-stroyed by the game and the vermin protected in the covers. Latterly the system of planting has been di@ﬀerent from what it used to be. We used to have preserves of several hundred acres in which the game found shelter, and of course did great damage to the adjacent crops but now we have patches and copses of woodland in every three or four @ﬁelds, small in size, but su@ﬀicient for the shelter and breeding of the game-a sort of pen in which game is folded, ready to consume the produce of every @ﬁeld, so that none should escape. The foxes have been lately all de-stroyed, and the country has no longer been hunted as it used to be, although some hounds still are kept. The foxes were the farmers' friends in this county, as they kept down the rabbits but since game has been sold, they have been found to interfere too much with the pro@ﬁts and although no landlord will admit that he has ordered a fox to be killed, it is certain that they have almost wholly dis-appeared. Formerly, when game was reared only for sport, foxes were respected, being equally entitled to protection as a@ﬀording another variety of amusement to others but now that game is a source of pro@ﬁt, that gentlemanly feel-ing appears to have been lost. From the want of statistics, it is impossible to say what proportion of the land in the country is at present in plan-tation and wood. The total number of acres in Norfolk are stated to be 1,338,880, of which it is computed that there are in arable, meadow, and marsh, 1,082,567. This leaves a balance of 256,813 acres of land for the sites of towns, roads, plan-tations, and waste land. How much of this may be in wood and plantation, it is impossible to say for want of statistics but admitting that there is one-half, we have 128,156 acres of land untilled in this county alone, and that with a popu-lation su@ﬀering from want of employment. And now let me prove the truth of my assertion, that the preservation of game is very injurious to the agricultural labourer, as in the @ﬁrst place it raises the price of his food. I have before expressed my opinion that whatever bene@ﬁt might occur to the nation from the free trade in corn, it would not prove of advantage to the agricultural labourer, as with the permanent fall of the price of corn his wages would be lowered in proportion. But if corn could be ren-dered cheaper, and the English farmer not lose by the re
