In due exercise of his functions, the Provost, on the 20th ult., went early in the morning, accompanied by a sufficient force, to the house of the recreant blacksmith, and finding him still in bed, made him get up, and con ducted him to the church of St Seviour, where he found Oline with her witnesses, and the clergyman ready at the altar. The Provost having exhibited the decrees of the Court, the priest, in obedience to the laws, commenced the marriage service, and was on the point of pronounc ing the words which would have irrevocably bound the two parties in the bonds of matrimony, when Mikkelsen, who had hitherto preserved a dogged silence, cried out lustily, Stop, stop ! I am willing to pay the damages. The ceremony was suspended, and before he was suffered to depart from the church he gave security for its discharge by instalments. When he came out he found a crowd of the lower orders, who greeted him with hooting and opprobrious cries.-' Galignani.' Duel Prevented.-The duel which was to have taken place at Algiers, between Generals de Bourgon and de Rourjolli, has been prevented by the friendly exhortations of M. Duprech, the Bishop of Algiers. Temperance in Prussia.-The soldiers serving in the Prussian dominions have been allowed by the Govern ment to receive, instead of their daily rations of brandy, the value of the same in money. This step is calculated to promote the principles of the temperance societies, which, through their officers, have formally returned thanks to the King for the privilege thus conferred. The Prince de Joinville.-The following are some of the details of the late tripflMfahe Prince de Joinville across the Channel to the coast of England, and princi pally to Brighton, accompanied by the Minister of Public Works and General d'Houdetot, as we have already noticed -His Royal Highness and his companions, on reaching the floating breakwater, which is placed about three miles from the shore, at Brighton, found that two-thirds of this defence remained entire. They went upon it, and entered the hut erected for the keeper of the light, whom the Prince closely interrogated. This man attri buted the accident to the pertinacity of the constructor in not allowing the mooring chain to be sufficiently strong. Upon this and the other information gained, no doubt was left in the minds of the inquirers as to the solidity of the breakwater itself, which, though incomplete, had for eight moflths sustained all the assaults of the most furious waves, and resisted even the recent hurricane which had done such vast damage in Normandy. By a singular coincidence, his Royal Highness had on his return strong proof of the utility these breakwaters would have on the French side of the Channel, by his vessel, the Pluton, being obliged to make for Havre, instead of enter ing Treport harbour, as she might have done had it been protected by one of them. The future President of Mexico.-The candidate for this office most likely to succeed is General Almonte, the son of a priest named Moreles, who played a distin guished part in the first insurrection. It is said that the name of Almonte originated in the circumstance, that when the insurgents were attacked by the Spaniards, the father's first cry was, El nino al monte! the child into the wood! . Almonte has been partly educated in the United States, and is far superior to the greater number of his fellow-countrymen. Turning the Tables.-The 'Gazette des Tribu-naux furnishes us with the following amusing anecdote - An ancient notary, M. S-, noted for his love of the enjoyments of life and his taste in gastronomy, was lamenting the postponement of the opening of the shoot ing season, which deprived him for ten days of many a delicious morsel, when a man in the furred jacket and cap of a conducteur de diligence came to him and informed him that, on the road to Paris, the Baron de BJa , who was at his country seat at Luc, had desired him to bring to M. S- an enormous basket which, from its appearance, contained not less than half a buck, six hares, twenty quails, and a dozen partridges. The conducteur, in dread of the new game law, refused to take charge of the basket, but was at last induced to do so on the assurance of the Baron that M. S- would find the means of getting it into Paris, if it were but left at Nanterre. After a long conference on the difficulties attending the introduction of this tempting present, the conducteur agreed to undertake this perilous job on receiving 60f., part of which he pretended must be dis bursed by him in bribes. The money was given, and the conducteur departed with confident assurance that the game would be in the epicure's larder before the follow ing morning. The morrow and two successive days having passed over without the delivery of the expected treat, or any notice from the conducteur, M. S- con cluded that he was done out of his 60f., and went to divert his chagrin by taking a walk in the garden of the Palais Royal. Here he met his worthy friend the eon-ducteur strolling round the basin, but dressed in fashion able attire, instead of his jacket and cap. On being COMMERCIAL INTERCOURSE WITH CENTRAL AFRICA. !, W f C i ? Py - fr ° m - the columns of Le Constitutionnel' the following interesting article on the subject of the internal commerce of Africa -The fact is now p aced beyond a doubt that a very considerable commercial movement formerly existed between the Barbary regencies, Morocco, and the interior of the African continent. The want of security may, perhaps, nave retarded it for some years, but the tendency, the necessities, and the habits of tile people still remain, and it will be possible, by well-organized efforts, to restore to this commerce all its importance. The routes by which the goods and merchandise disembarked at Bona, Algiers, or Oran, are conveyed, are at present perfectly well known. Upon these routes are observed towns which serve as magazines or storehouses for the caravans, or as entrepots for the commodities such seem to advance abreast towards the I esert. Thus Constantine, Medeah, Mascara, and Tlemcen form, on departing from the sea shore, the first line of markets for the produce of Europe. Tibessa, Biscara, Bouijoada, Laghouat, and Stitten, con stitute the second line and on the third, we find the Oued-Souf, Tuggurt, Ouerguela, and Mettili. Farther Sur! . Sha11 haTC resident here at on, but still presenting themselves in a parallel line, are El-Sedames, El-Colea, and El-Arib. The merchandise which, from these three last points, is sent forward to wards the south, meets on its route with a most impor tant market, that divides the crossing of the Desert, and forms the great oasis of Touat. From this station the caravans, which are there assembled by concentration, take different routes, in order to proceed to the various parts of the Soudan, Our readers are aware that all commerce in that country is carried on by means of caravans. Exposed to the attacks and the robberies of the inhabitants of the Desert, the merchants are com pelled to purchase the protection of the chiefs of these pirates of the Sahara. Amongst these tribes, the greatest and most numerous is, without doubt, that of the Touareg. They are excellent horsemen, and from time immemorial they have enjoyed the privilege of providing the escorts for the protection of the passage of the caravans. The Touaregs are a Barbary race they profess the Mussul man religion according to the Malekite rites it is said that they have a pale complexion, and that they wear pantaloons which strongly resemble in their closely-fitting form the pantaloons of the Europeans. Their women have blue eyes, and some of them are surprisingly pale. They the women smoke a great deal, and are considered very passionate they cultivate poetry with marked taste. It is related by Arabs who have made several journeys with the Touaregs, that these nomads are in the habit, when they cross the Desert, of placing inscriptions upon all the stones with which they meet. These inscriptions, which are most frequently in verse, set forth the lofty deeds of the writer, or, otherwise, challenges to an enemy, or the praises of a favourite flame. It is not uncommon to ffind verses addressed to an unknown beauty, in whicn the poet hopes to soften the heart of the first beautiful girl who shall chance to read them. The woman who desires to reciprocate the love of the poet writes under the first in scription a reply, wherein she betrays her name, and makes herself known. This amorous correspondence is very frequent. But what is still more curious, and worthy of riveting the attention of all our archaeologists and philologists, is the fact that these inscriptions are written in characters which do not resemble in the slightest dogree the Arabic characters, and which the natives look uponasthe written alphabet of the Targuia, or Barbary, tongue. The most credible conjectures give reason to believe that these characters are borrowed from the Phoenician writings. At Ouerguela there are Arte sian wells hollowed out of the stone, and the piercing of which is ascribed by the tradition of the country to Alexander the Great. From Tuggart to Timbuctoo, the caravans are thirty-seven da 's on the road, including twenty-nine encampments but eight days are devoted to repose at different parts of this long march. It will be easy to render still more complete the information that has been already collected respecting the Sahara t and the manners of its inhabitants, by sending native ex plorers, already initiated in European civilization, who will be able to penetrate without danger into the very centre of Africa. NATIVE AMERICANISM. The National Convention of Native Americans, held at Philadelphia in the early part of July, adopted an ad dress to their fellow citizens of the United States, with a declaration of principles which .are essentially embodied in the following resolutions -RESOLUTION'S ADOPTED JULY 5 AND 7, 1845. Believing our free institutions, if worth anything, to be worth preserving, and transmitting unimpaired. Believing the permanency of those institutions to de pend upon the honest and intelligent exercise of the right of suffrage. Believing that ruin, if it come, will come through a perversion and abuse of that right. Believing such perversion and abuse to have already prevailed, and to be now increasing to an alarming ex tent. Believing that the greatest source of evil in this respect is to be found in the rapid influx of ignorant foreigners, and the facility with which they are converted into citizens. Believing that Americans in form should, and of right ought to be, Americans at heart. Believing that under any circumstances it is dangerous 4. Resolved, That the Bible, as the only basis of rh.i. tiaiuty, lies at the bottom of all truelibei ty a nde,,u a utv and thus, as the corner-stone of our fie should be freely read by all men. 5. Resolved, That removals from important offices under the general government should be made like ap pointments, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, or other approving body, except in the absence of the Senate, when the President may have the power to suspend for cause. 6. Resolved, That these principles, lying as they do at the very foundation of our political freedom, and our na tional existence, involve, and are paramount to all others, however important to our external prosperity. _ 7. Resolved, That the interest, the honour of the na tion, as well as the real welfare of all parties, require that subordinate party questions should be made to yield to the great principles for which we are contending. 8. Resolved, That organizations of Native American associations should be established in all the townships and wards of cities throughout the United States. 9. Resolved, That the appointment of two delegates from each congressional district, be recommended to meet in general convention, on the second Tuesday of May, 1847, to nominate candidates for President and Vice-Pre sident of the United States, and that the place of meeting be Pittsburg, Pennsylvania. 10. Resolved, That we advocate the principle that no alien should be naturalized, except on the production of a Custom-house certificate, to be procured ou liis landing on these American shores, proving his residence of twenty-one years such certificate to be given up to be cancelled. 11. Resolved, That we hold it to be the duty of all true native Americans to give their suffrages to those only who subscribe heartily to our principles, and will maintain them. 12. Resolved, That as native Americans we hold it to be our duty to take high moral grounds on all subjects, to grapple with the principles of right, of truth, and of justice, without regard to mere questions of availability, and to contend for them fearlessly against the world. 13. Resolved, That the several executive committees of the States be requested to appoint, each two proper per sons, to constitute a corresponding national committee. 14. Resolved, That while every constitutional effort should be made to guard against the deleterious conse quences of a rapidly-increasing immigration, by the enactment of the most efficient laws for the accomplish ment of that all-important object, still a generous mag nanimity requires that those aliens who are, or may be come, inhabitants of the United States, should be kindly received, and every privilege extended to them, except that of participating in any of our political administra tions, and exercising the right of suffrage, until after a residence of at least twenty-one years. 15. Resolved, That as native Americans, we will foster and defend all the great interests of our country, its agriculture, its commerce, its mechanics, manufactures, navigation, mining, and science, fine arts, and literature, against the world. 16. Resolved, That we do advocate the passage of laws imposing upon all foreigners coming hither for purposes of permanent residence a capitation tax sufficiently large to prevent the excessive influx of vicious and pauper immigrants, and that we do this as a matter of self-defence. 17. Resolved, That we urge the promotion and foster ing of all means of moral and intellectual culture, by per manent provisions for general education, believing the in telligence of the people to be necessary to the right use and the permanence of our liberties, civil and religious. 18. Resolved, that the native American party do, and will continue to advocate the principle that the naturali zation of foreigners be confined exclusively to the courts of the United States, and also that a public registration of all applicants for the elective franchise be made. 19. Resolved, That we advocate the universal toleration of every religious faith and sect, and the total separation of all sectarianism and politics. 20. Resolved, That we recommend that no alien be permitted to land in these United States without a certi ficate of good moral character, and who is able to provide for his own support, which certificate shall be signed by the United States Consul of the port whence he sailed, and also that a registry be made of said alien, in con formity with the Act of Congress, passed in 1802, under President Jefferson. accosted by M. S-, and asked what had become of his ■ to commit the ballet box, the ark of our freedom's cove-basket of game, the audacious fellow coolly replied that it had been seized. 4 Oh, oh ! ' replied M. S-, ' well, then, as my basket has been seized, I will seize a thief ' and, suiting the action to the word, he, though more than nant, to foreign hands, or submit our destinies to the pos sible control of them, who may be foreigners in heart, and Americans in form only.

The Eagle, Strai-ton, at Leith Roads, from that place, has about 100 tons on board, and would have had a full cargo, but ran short of powder for blasting. She left the Magnet, of Peter head, loading, with from thirty to forty tons on board. The Comet and Venus, of Leith, had just commenced. Therefore, 1. Resolved, That we do hereby form our selves into a national political party, for the radical re form of abuses, and the preservation of our institutions LAW. The Game Laws.-At the Deddington Oxon petty sessions on the 6th inst., before Mr F. S. Cox, John Car penter, of Sandford, labourer, was charged by Richard Morris, a gamekeeper, for Mr Bolton, with having, on the 29th of August, at Sandford, used a snare for the purpose of taking game without having a certificate so to do, wi.ercby he had rendered himself liable to a penalty of 20 . Car penter did not appear. Gardner, a police oflicpr, said, he on the previous morning served a duplicate of the summons on the wife, who then told him that she did not know where her husband was, and that she had not seen him since the morning that the keeper sought him. The clerk seemed to doubt whether the summons had been served long enough to justify the case being gone on with in Carpenter's absence. Mr Cox considered that time enough had elapsed, and said that Carpenter had left on purpose, because he should not be served, and to avoid these proceedings. The police officer said he understood that he h id left a place of work, and had gone off in consequence of the keeper having taken him. John Sanbrook, a looker-out for the above Mr Bolton, said, On the evening of the 28th of August, he found a snare, and watched it. At about half-past five the next morning, Carpenter came to it, took a hare from it, and was about removing the snare when wit ness look him into custody, took the hare from him, and searched him, but found nothing in his pockets, but he had a loaded gun with him, a powder flask, and a shot-belt. Took his gun from him, but gave him it again, because it was not on their manor, and he did not know whether • l.e and our liberties, under the name of the Native Americans' j could answer taking it away. It did not appear that Car-Party. j penter had been previously convicted. Mr Cox said ue 2.

The Game Laws.-At the Deddington Oxon petty sessions on the 6th inst., before Mr F. S. Cox, John Car@ penter, of Sandford, labourer, was charged by Richard Morris, a gamekeeper, for Mr Bolton, with having, on the 29th of August, at Sandford, used a snare for the purpose of taking game without having a certificate so to do, wi.ercby he had rendered himself liable to a penalty of 20 . Car@ penter did not appear. Gardner, a police oflicpr, said, he on the previous morning served a duplicate of the summons on the wife, who then told him that she did not know where her husband was, and that she had not seen him since the morning that the keeper sought him. The clerk seemed to doubt whether the summons had been served long enough to justify the case being gone on with in Carpenter's absence. Mr Cox considered that time enough had elapsed, and said that Carpenter had left on purpose, because he should not be served, and to avoid these proceedings. The police officer said he understood that he h id left a place of work, and had gone off in consequence of the keeper having taken him. John Sanbrook, a looker-out for the above Mr Bolton, said, On the evening of the 28th of August, he found a snare, and watched it. At about half-past five the next morning, Carpenter came to it, took a hare from it, and was about removing the snare when wit@ ness look him into custody, took the hare from him, and searched him, but found nothing in his pockets, but he had a loaded gun with him, a powder flask, and a shot-belt. Took his gun from him, but gave him it again, because it was not on their manor, and he did not know whether @• l.e and our liberties, under the name of the Native Americans' j could answer taking it away. It did not appear that Car-Party. j penter had been previously convicted. Mr Cox said ue 2.

In due exercise of his functions, the Provost, on the 20th ult., went early in the morning, accompanied by a su@@ﬃcient force, to the house of the recreant blacksmith, and @ﬁnding him still in bed, made him get up, and con- ducted him to the church of St Seviour, where he found Oline with her witnesses, and the clergyman ready at the altar. The Provost having exhibited the decrees of the Court, the priest, in obedience to the laws, commenced the marriage service, and was on the point of pronounc- ing the words which would have irrevocably bound the two parties in the bonds of matrimony, when Mikkelsen, who had hitherto preserved a dogged silence, cried out lustily, Stop, stop !

Duprech, the Bishop of Algiers. ########################## soldiers serving in the Prussian dominions have been allowed by the Govern- ment to receive, instead of their daily rations of brandy, the value of the same in money. This step is calculated to promote the principles of the temperance societies, which, through their o@@ﬃcers, have formally returned thanks to the King for the privilege thus conferred. ############################ following are some of the details of the late ####### the Prince de Joinville across the Channel to the coast of England, and princi- pally to Brighton, accompanied by the Minister of Public Works and General d'Houdetot, as we have already noticed -His Royal Highness and his companions, on reaching the @ﬂoating breakwater, which is placed about three miles from the shore, at Brighton, found that two- thirds of this defence remained entire. They went upon it, and entered the hut erected for the keeper of the light, whom the Prince closely interrogated. This man attri- buted the accident to the pertinacity of the constructor in not allowing the mooring chain to be su@@ﬃciently strong. Upon this and the other information gained, no doubt was left in the minds of the inquirers as to the solidity of the breakwater itself, which, though incomplete, had for eight mo@nths sustained all the assaults of the most furious waves, and resisted even the recent hurricane which had done such vast damage in Normandy. By a singular coincidence, his Royal Highness had on his return a strong proof of the utility these breakwaters would have on the French side of the Channel, by his vessel, the Pluton, being obliged to make for Havre, instead of enter- ing Treport harbour, as she might have done had it been protected by one of them. ################################### candidate for this o@@ﬃce most likely to succeed is General Almonte, the son of a priest named Moreles, who played a distin- guished part in the @ﬁrst insurrection. It is said that the name of Almonte originated in the circumstance, that when the insurgents were attacked by the Spaniards, the father's @ﬁrst cry was, El nino al monte ! the child into the wood ! . Almonte has been partly educated in the United States, and is far superior to the greater number of his fellow‐countrymen. ####################### ' Gazette des Tribu- naux ' furnishes us with the following amusing anecdote - An ancient notary, M. S-, noted for his love of the enjoyments of life and his taste in gastronomy, was lamenting the postponement of the opening of the shoot- ing season, which deprived him for ten days of many a delicious morsel, when a man in the furred jacket and cap of a conducteur de diligence came to him and informed him that, on the road to Paris, the Baron de Bla , who was at his country seat at Luc, had desired him to bring to M. S-@an enormous basket which, from its appearance, contained not less than half a buck, six hares, twenty quails, and a dozen partridges. The conducteur, in dread of the new game law, refused to take charge of the basket, but was at last induced to do so on the assurance of the Baron that M. S-@would @ﬁnd the means of getting it into Paris, if it were but left at Nanterre. After a long conference on the di@@ﬃculties attending the introduction of this tempting present, the conducteur agreed to undertake this perilous job on receiving 60f., part of which he pretended must be dis- bursed by him in bribes. The money was given, and the conducteur departed with con@ﬁdent assurance that the game would be in the epicure's larder before the follow- ing morning. The morrow and two successive days having passed over without the delivery of the expected treat, or any notice from the conducteur, M. S-@con- cluded that he was done out of his 60f., and went to divert his chagrin by taking a walk in the garden of the Palais Royal. Here he met his worthy friend the con- ducteur strolling round the basin, but dressed in fashion- able attire, instead of his jacket and cap. On ############################################################################ the columns of ' Le Constitutionnel' the following interesting article on the subject of the internal commerce of Africa - The fact is now placed beyond a doubt that a very considerable commercial movement formerly existed between the Barbary regencies, Morocco, and the interior of the African continent. The want of security may, perhaps, have retarded it for some years, but the tendency, the necessities, and the habits of t@he people still remain, and it will be possible, by well‐organized e@ﬀorts, to restore to this commerce all its importance. The routes by which the goods and merchandise disembarked at Bona, Algiers, or Oran, are conveyed, are at present perfectly well known. Upon these routes are observed towns which serve as magazines or storehouses for the caravans, or as entrepots for the commodities such seem to advance abreast towards the @Desert. Thus Constantine, Medeah, Mascara, and Tlemcen form, on departing from the sea shore, the @ﬁrst line of markets for the produce of Europe. Tibessa, Biscara, Bou@çaada, Laghouat, and Stitten, con- stitute the second line and on the third, we @ﬁnd the Oued‐Souf, Tuggurt, Ouerguela, and Mettili. ########################################## on, but still presenting themselves in a parallel line, are El‐Sedamès, El‐Coleá, and El‐Arib. The merchandise which, from these three last points, is sent forward to wards the south, meets on its route with a most impor- tant market, that divides the crossing of the Desert, and forms the great oasis of Touat. From this station the caravans, which are there assembled by concentration, take di@ﬀerent routes, in order to proceed to the various parts of the Soudan. Our readers are aware that all commerce in that country is carried on by means of caravans. Exposed to the attacks and the robberies of the inhabitants of the Desert, the merchants are com- pelled to purchase the protection of the chiefs of these pirates of the Sahara. Amongst these tribes, the greatest and most numerous is, without doubt, that of the Touareg. They are excellent horsemen, and from time immemorial they have enjoyed the privilege of providing the escorts for the protection of the passage of the caravans. The Touaregs are a Barbary race they profess the Mussul- man religion according to the Malekite rites it is said that they have a pale complexion, and that they wear pantaloons which strongly resemble in their closely@‐ﬁtting form the pantaloons of the Europeans. Their women have blue eyes, and some of them are surprisingly pale. They the women smoke a great deal, and are considered very passionate they cultivate poetry with marked taste. It is related by Arabs who have made several journeys with the Touaregs, that these nomads are in the habit, when they cross the Desert, of placing inscriptions upon all the stones with which they meet. These inscriptions, which are most frequently in verse, set forth the lofty deeds of the writer, or, otherwise, challenges to an enemy, or the praises of a favourite @ﬂame. It is not uncommon to @@ﬁnd verses addressed to an unknown beauty, in which the poet hopes to soften the heart of the @ﬁrst beautiful girl who shall chance to read them. The woman who desires to reciprocate the love of the poet writes under the @ﬁrst in- scription a reply, wherein she betrays her name, and makes herself known. This amorous correspondence is very frequent. But what is still more curious, and worthy of riveting the attention of all our archaeologists and philologists, is the fact that these inscriptions are written in characters which do not resemble in the slightest degree the Arabic characters, and which the natives look upon as the written alphabet of the Targuia, or Barbary, tongue. The most credible conjectures give reason to believe that these characters are borrowed from the Phoenician writings. At Ouerguela there are Arte- sian wells hollowed out of the stone, and the piercing of which is ascribed by the tradition of the country to Alexander the Great. From Tuggart to Timbuctoo, the caravans are thirty‐seven da@ys on the road, including twenty‐nine encampments but eight days are devoted to repose at di@ﬀerent parts of this long march. It will be easy to render still more complete the information that has been already collected respecting the Sahara@, and the manners of its inhabitants, by sending native ex- plorers, already initiated in European civilization, who will be able to penetrate without danger into the very centre of ############################################################################################# in the early part of July, adopted an ad- dress to their fellow citizens of the United States, with a declaration of principles which @are essentially embodied in the following resolutions -RESOLUTION@S ADOPTED JULY 5 AND 7, 1845. Believing our free institutions, if worth anything, to be worth preserving, and transmitting unimpaired. Believing the permanency of those institutions to de- pend upon the honest and intelligent exercise of the right of su@ﬀrage. Believing that ruin, if it come, will come through a perversion and abuse of that right. Believing such perversion and abuse to have already prevailed, and to be now increasing to an alarming ex- tent. Believing that the greatest source of evil in this respect is to be found in the rapid in@ﬂux of ignorant foreigners, and the facility with which they are converted into citizens. Believing that Americans in form should, and of right ought to be, Americans at heart. Believing that under any circumstances it is dangerous ##################### Bible, as the only basis of Chris- tianity, lies at the bottom of all truelibe@rty ############## and thus, as the corner‐stone of our ########## be freely read by all men. 5. Resolved, That removals from important o@@ﬃces under the general government should be made like ap- pointments, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, or other approving body, except in the absence of the Senate, when the President may have the power to suspend for cause. 6. Resolved, That these principles, lying as they do at the very foundation of our political freedom, and our na- tional existence, involve, and are paramount to all others, however important to our external prosperity.y. 7. Resolved, That the interest, the honour of the na‐ tion, as well as the real welfare of all parties, require that subordinate party questions should be made to yield to the great principles for which we are contending. 8. Resolved, That organizations of Native American associations should be established in all the townships and wards of cities throughout the United States. 9. Resolved, That the appointment of two delegates from each congressional district, be recommended to meet in general convention, on the second Tuesday of May, 1847, to nominate candidates for President and Vice‐Pre- sident of the United States, and that the place of meeting be Pittsburg, Pennsylvania. 10. Resolved, That we advocate the principle that no alien should be naturalized, except on the production of a Custom‐house certi@ﬁcate, to be procured on @his landing on these American shores, proving his residence of twenty- one years such certi@ﬁcate to be given up to be cancelled. 11. Resolved, That we hold it to be the duty of all true native Americans to give their su@ﬀrages to those only who subscribe heartily to our principles, and will maintain them. 12. Resolved, That as native Americans we hold it to be our duty to take high moral grounds on all subjects, to grapple with the principles of right, of truth, and of justice, without regard to mere questions of availability, and to contend for them fearlessly against the world. 13. Resolved, That the several executive committees of the States be requested to appoint, each two proper per- sons, to constitute a corresponding national committee. 14. Resolved, That while every constitutional e@ﬀort should be made to guard against the deleterious conse- quences of a rapidly‐increasing immigration, by the enactment of the most e@@ﬃcient laws for the accomplish- ment of that all‐important object, still a generous mag- nanimity requires that those aliens who are, or may be- come, inhabitants of the United States, should be kindly received, and every privilege extended to them, except that of participating in any of our political administra- tions, and exercising the right of su@ﬀrage, until after a residence of at least twenty‐one years. 15. Resolved, That as native Americans, we will foster and defend all the great interests of our country, its agriculture, its commerce, its mechanics, manufactures, navigation, mining, and science, @ﬁne arts, and literature, against the world. 16. Resolved, That we do advocate the passage of laws imposing upon all foreigners coming hither for purposes of permanent residence a capitation tax su@@ﬃciently large to prevent the excessive in@ﬂux of vicious and pauper immigrants, and that we do this as a matter of self- defence. 17. Resolved, That we urge the promotion and foster- ing of all means of moral and intellectual culture, by per- manent provisions for general education, believing the in- telligence of the people to be necessary to the right use and the permanence of our liberties, civil and religious. 18. Resolved, that the native American party do, and will continue to advocate the principle that the naturali- zation of foreigners be con@ﬁned exclusively to the courts of the United States, and also that a public registration of all applicants for the elective franchise be made. 19.
