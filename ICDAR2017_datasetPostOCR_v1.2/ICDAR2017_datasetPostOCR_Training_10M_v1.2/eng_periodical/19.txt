HER MAJESTY'S RETURN FROM GERMANY AND VISIT to the KING OF THE FRENCH. On Wednesday, the 3rd inst., at eight o'clock in the morning, the Queen and Prince Albert started from Gotha upon their homeward route, by way of Fulda and Frank fort. The Duke and Duchess accompanied her Majesty and the Prince for a short way out of Gotha towards the frontier of Weimar, on approaching which they took leave of their Royal visitors, and returned to Frederickstahl. The country after leaving Gotha is no way remarkable, the road bordered by tall poplars, running straight as an h arrow through a flat fertile country. As Eisenach is ap proached the scenery improves. High green banks, here smooth and sloping, there broken and precipitous, rise on either side of the road which occupies the rich valley be tween. Unfinished portions of a railway in progress stretch alongside it. Eisenach is rather a large place, possessing the usual characteristics of German country towns, in its white houses, narrow streets, clumps of trees growing out of the rough paving, and here and there old fountains and elaborately constructed pumps. Here her Majesty breakfasted at the Government house, which stands in the market-place. She was received by the Grand Duke of Saxe Weimar. A guard of honour was in attendance, and the towns-people turned out as well as the soldiers. On a height above Eisenach stands the Castle of Wartsburg, celebrated as the prison of Martin Luther, and where he executed his German translation of the Bible. Her Majesty, accompanied by the Grand Duke of Saxe Weimar, did not fail to visit it. The re mainder of the route lay through a very romantic country to Fulda, where her Majesty and suite arrived at eight o'clock in the evening. The cortege stopped at the prin cipal hotel, the Kurfurst, within which the Grand Duke of Hesse Cassel was waiting in readiness to receive the Royal travellers. A regiment of Hessian soldiers were drawn up opposite the hotel, and a dense crowd of the good people of Fulda supported them. The Queen alighted amid general cheering. The Hessian band con tinued to serenade her for about an hour, and the hotel and the neighbouring houses were pleasingly illuminated in honour of Die Konigen von England. On Thursday, the 4th inst., her Majesty continued her journey through Gelnhausen, where stand the ruins of the palace of the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, and Hanau, a tolerably large place containing about 14,000 inhabitants, and the scene of more than one warlike exploit. It was gallantly defended for nine months during the thirty years' ar, and in later days Napoleon, while in hot retreat from Lcipsic, dashed through the allied troops of the Austrians and Bavarians under its walls. The Queen reached I' rankfort at three o'clock in the afternoon, and descended at the Hotel d'Angleterre, where a body of the City guard as drawn up to receive her Majesty. In the evening, j after dinner, there was a reception or levee, at which the Karl and Countess of Westmoreland, the Burgomaster, and some others of the authorities of Frankfort were pre sented. Prince Metternich and the King of Bavaria dined with the Royal party. lying. They then embarked on board the ' Fairy,' which brought them rapidly down the river towards Cologne. They landed at Deutz, opposite Cologne, at half-past five o clock, and proceeded at once to the Hotel de Bellevue, where they slept. The day was remarkably fine, so that her Majesty had the best opportunity of seeing the scenery of the Rhine. Lord Adolphus Fitzclarence was waiting on board the 'Fairy,' and accompanied her Majesty. The Royal party left Cologne on Saturday morning by a special train, at a few minutes after nine o'clock, and arrived at Antwerp a little before six, where the King and Queen of the Belgians were in waiting to receive her Majesty. In the evening a grand banquet took place in the palace. Her Majesty had originally intended to dine on board the yacht, and drop down the Scheldt that even ing, and a special messenger had been despatched from Cologne the previous evening to make the necessary arrangements. King Leopold, however, countermanded the order, taking upon himself the responsibility of assur ing the officers on board that he would prevail on the Queen to dine at the palace. At half-past seven the town was brilliantly illuminated. Along the streets tall posts were placed at intervals, surmounted by rows of lamps in the form of a pyramid the fronts of most of the houses, and all the public buildings, were also lighted up with rows of coloured lamps. The facade of the Governor's house was one blaze of light, showing off very artisti cally the fresco decorations of the arms of England and Belgium, surrounded by wreaths of flowers and gilded scrolls, which were emblazoned on the spaces between the windows. The Hotel de Ville had the whole of its vast range of windows lighted up, five tiers of lamps run ning from the basement story to the roof, and pouring a flood of light upon the admiring crowds in the Grand place below. The principal gate, leading to the quay, was another object of attraction it was surmounted by a pile of flags of all nations, the arms of England and Bel gium being conspicuously displayed in the centre, stars and scrolls of gas, with the ciphers of the English and Belgian Sovereigns, were exhibited on the river front, the whole surrounded by coloured lamps, and wreaths of laurel and evergreen. The quays, however, presented the most striking and beautiful effect. Along either bank cones of fire elevated on poles extended the whole length of the city, and in the intervals lighted torches and tar barrels cast a wild and lurid light upon the crowds who poured along the quays. The Tete de Flandres, on the opposite side of the river, was also one blaze of light, rows of lamps displaying the various lines of its batteries and entrenchments, the whole of the left bank bristled with tar and pitch barrels, aroundwhich the dark figures of the men employed to feed the flame vvere seen hovering at intervals, their figures casting gigantic shadows across the stream. The English Government steamers, and the other vessels in the river, were also hung with lamps. The General Steam Navigation Company's steam ship ' Soho,' which was moored in the centre of the stream, opposite the Royal yacht, being conspicuous for the variety and brilliancy of its illuminations. At intervals during the night blue and red signal lights were burned, lighting up the river, the quays, and slipping with a strange and dazzling glare. Again, sheaves of rockets went roaring into the air, scattering their brilliant stars over the Scheldt, and on the deep and rapid stream below thousands of boats, from the light skiff to the heavy lum bering coal barge freighted with the worthy citizens of Antwerp, and carrying torches of pine in the bow and stern, floated to and fro, chanting their national airs in full, deep chtrus, and with these were mingled the oaths, imprecations, confusion, and uproar that followed the fre quent collisions of the river craft, the strains of military music from the banks, the hum and Babel of the many thousands who promenaded along the quays, and above all, the solemn peals of the Cathedral bells, and the roar of artillery from the citadel. At nine o'clock the Queen and her suite left the palate and proceeded through the Place de Meer, the Marche aux Souliers, by the Hotel de Ville and the Canal au Beurre to the quays, alongside which the Koyal yacht was moored. The progress of the Royal party was extremely slow, in consequence of the crowded state of the streets, but it afforded the Queen and the Prince an opportunity of viewing the illumina tions and the other demonstrations of respect which were exhibited along their route. On approaching the Cathedral a signal was given, and instantly the whole of the magni ficent tower was illuminated with Bengal lights. The effect was extremely fine, every taper shaft, and pillar, carved ornament, and delicate tracery of this most beau tiful specimen of Gothic architecture being distinctly re vealed, and standing out like pure white marble on the dark sky. A loud burst of applause followed this magni ficent spectacle. A few minutes, and the brilliant pa geant was gone, and the Queen was on board the Royal yacht, which remained alongside the quay during the night. A guard of Belgian soldiers was stationed there to prevent the intrusion of the crowd, and up to a late hour the river continued crowded with boats, torches flared wildly over the heads of the revellers, or were struck upon the gunwale in tune to the music, and showered streams of fire into the hissing flood, the lights and figures reflected and multiplied on the surface of the black and boiling current. At seven o'clock on Sunday morning the yacht got under weigh, a Royal salute was fired from the citadel, the vessels on the river were dressed out with flags, and accompanied by the ' Black Eagle,' ' Lightning,' and ' Porcupine ' Government steamers, the ' Victoria and Albert' proceeded rapidly down the Scheldt. The squad ron reached Flushing at one o'clock, and then hove to. The Earl of Aberdeen and two others of her Majesty's suite went ashore, and made an excursion to Middleburgh, and at half-past four the squadron again got under weigh, and proceeded down the Channel with a fair wind. On Sunday, the 7th inst., her Majesty left the Scheldt, Early on Friday morning, the 5th inst., the Royal party started by special train for Wiesbaden, and thence to -• ~v-v '• Biberich in carriages, where they embarked on board a and on the following morning the Royal yacht anchored Cologne steamer hired for the purpose, which brought off Tveport, an intimation having been previously sent to them down the Rhine to Bingen, where the 'Fairy' was the King of the French that her Majesty would accept the pressing invitation of Louis Philippe to visit him m passant at the Chateau of Eu. At eight o'clock the King and Queen of the French the Princess Adelaide, and all the members of the Royal family, arrived at Trfeport in the grand cliar-a-banc, fol lowed by eight or ten other carriages. The King looked better than he has done for six months. Half an hour afterwards the British steamer, with the Royal standard of England displayed, was within a mile of the shore. King Louis Philippe immediately entered a barge, with a few attendants, and proceeded to the ' Courrier' steamer, in which he approached the 1 Victoria and Albert.' From the ' Courrier' his Majesty descended into a boat fully manned, and pulled to the ' Victoria and Albert.' Some little bustle took place, and then the Royal party de scended into the barge, in which they were rowed towards the shore. In consequence, however, of its being nearly low water the barge could not land, and as the strand was distant from the road, a curious but simple expedient to obviate the difficulty suggested itself to the King. His Majesty ordered the horse to be attached to one of the numerous large bathing machines on the strand, and by aid of it the Queen was enabled to reach the shore, a mode of travelling which very much amused the illustri ous visitor. Planks having been laid down on the beach for the use of the Royal party, the Queen advanced to meet Queen Victoria, whom she greeted most cordially, and embraced several times. Her Majesty also kissed Prince Albert on both cheeks. The Queen of the French then presented the Princess of Salerno and the Sicilian Princesses to her Majesty, after which the whole party got into char-a-bancs, the Queen sitting next to Louis Philippe, and Prince Albert next to the Queen of the French, and proceeded to the Chateau d'Eu, amidst the cordial applause of the assembled crowds. On ihe arrival of the Royal party at the chateau, a splendid dejeuner was served up, which was attended by all the visitors at the chateau. After the dejeuner Louis Philippe took the opportunity of introducing the Queen to the new Vic toria Gallery-a splendid gallery, intended to commemo rate her Majesty's first visit to the Chateau d'Eu, and which is decorated with views of the principal scenes of that occasion, painted by some of the first painters in France. This very handsome compliment to his guest was not thrown away. Her Majesty felt greatly gratified. In the afternoon the Royal party drove into the forest, and in the evening there was a splendid dinner at the chateau, which was attended by all the civil and military authorities of the place, as well as by the guests resident at the chateau. In the evening the Royal party attended a theatrical entertainment in the chateau, the performers of the Opera Comique having been sent for from Paris for the occasion. The performances were the ' Beau Seig neur' and ' Richard Cceur de Lion.' On Tuesday morning the Royal party again drove in the forest in char-a-bancs, and returned to the chateau at half-past one. The Queen and Prince Albert afterward# walked in the ground attached to the palace. Shortly be fore six in the evening her Majesty and the Prince, ac companied by the King and Queen of the French, left the Chateau d'Eu for Treport. A body of troops were sta tioned in the quadrangle of the palace, and a consider able crowd had gathered within its precincts. The vehi cles used were the same as those for the forenoon ride. As they passed out the band played the English national anthem, and the crowd shouted Vive le Roi des Fran-fais et la Reine d'Angletaire. At six o'clock the cortege arrived at the landing-place, the bells of the church ring ing merrily, and a distant battery of cannon firing a salute. The embarkation was speedily accomplished Louis Philippe handed the Queen on board, and the next moment the party was gliding rapidly seaward. Queen Victoria was the only lady on board the barge close to her sat the King of the French, Prince de Joinville, and Prince Albert Lord Aberdeen, M. Guizot, and Lord Liverpool, completed the party. The other members of the suite went in other boats. As the Royal barge shot past there was a tremendous rush along the jetty the steamers in the offing manned their yards, and the sea ward batteries fired double royal salutes. At half-past six o'clock the Royal party were safely on board the ' Vic toria and Albert,' and under weigh for England. The voyage across the Channel was prosperously performed-the weather continuing serene and the sea smooth. On Wednesday afternoon a telegraphic despatch from Portsmouth announced the safe arrival of her Majesty at Osborne house, in the Isle of Wight, after an absence from England of thirty-three days. THE FESTIVITIES AT PAMPELUNA. The preparations that have been made for the reception of the Queen and the Infanta of Spain and their Royal guests, the Duke and Duchess de Nemours and the Duke d'Aumale, are all on a scale of great splendour.

THE FESTIVITIES AT PAMPELUNA. The preparations that have been made for the reception of the Queen and the Infanta of Spain and their Royal guests, the Duke and Duchess de Nemours and the Duke d'Aumale, are all on a scale of great splendour. Bull-fighting forms, of course, the principal feature of the amusements. The following is the programme of the festivities preparing by the loyal Narvarese for their Sovereign and her guests - The Queen our Lady having deigned to select this ca pital in order to receive, in company with her august mother and sister, their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess de Nemours and the Duke d'Aumale on the 4th of Septem ber next, and the municipality being desirous of celebrating in the most becoming manner so joyful an event, has pre pared two bull-fights, the combatants at which will be the celebrated Montes and his troop, another o@ novillos young bulls which will be encountered with lances and darts, and slain by the youthful amateurs of this city various com-parsas and dances, splendid illuminations and fireworks prepared by eminent artists, and various other amusements.

HER MAJESTY'S RETURN FROM GERMANY AND VISIT TO THE KING OF THE FRENCH. On Wednesday, the 3rd inst., at eight o'clock in the morning, the Queen and Prince Albert started from Gotha upon their homeward route, by way of Fulda and Frank-fort. The Duke and Duchess accompanied her Majesty and the Prince for a short way out of Gotha towards the frontier of Weimar, on approaching which they took leave of their Royal visitors, and returned to Frederickstahl. The country after leaving Gotha is no way remarkable, the road bordered by tall poplars, running straight as an@@ arrow through a @ﬂat fertile country. As Eisenach is ap-proached the scenery improves. High green banks, here smooth and sloping, there broken and precipitous, rise on either side of the road which occupies the rich valley be-tween. Un@ﬁnished portions of a railway in progress stretch alongside it. Eisenach is rather a large place, possessing the usual characteristics of German country towns, in its white houses, narrow streets, clumps of trees growing out of the rough paving, and here and there old fountains and elaborately constructed pumps. Here her Majesty breakfasted at the Government house, which stands in the market-place. She was received by the Grand Duke of Saxe Weimar. A guard of honour was in attendance, and the towns-people turned out as well as the soldiers. On a height above Eisenach stands the Castle of Wartsburg, celebrated as the prison of Martin Luther, and where he executed his German translation of the Bible. Her Majesty, accompanied by the Grand Duke of Saxe Weimar, did not fail to visit it. The re-mainder of the route lay through a very romantic country to Fulda, where her Majesty and suite arrived at eight o'clock in the evening. The cortège stopped at the prin-cipal hotel, the Kurfurst, within which the Grand Duke of Hesse Cassel was waiting in readiness to receive the Royal travellers. A regiment of Hessian soldiers were drawn up opposite the hotel, and a dense crowd of the good people of Fulda supported them. The Queen alighted amid general cheering. The Hessian band con-tinued to serenade her for about an hour, and the hotel and the neighbouring houses were pleasingly illuminated in honour of Die Königen von England. On Thursday, the 4th inst., her Majesty continued her journey through Gelnhausen, where stand the ruins of the palace of the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, and Hanau, a tolerably large place containing about 14,000 inhabitants, and the scene of more than one warlike exploit. It was gallantly defended for nine months during the thirty years' war, and in later days Napoleon, while in hot retreat from Leipsic, dashed through the allied troops of the Austrians and Bavarians under its walls. The Queen reached @@Frankfort at three o'clock in the afternoon, and descended at the Hotel d'Angleterre, where a body of the City guard was drawn up to receive her Majesty. In the evening,@@ after dinner, there was a reception or levee, at which the Earl and Countess of Westmoreland, the Burgomaster, and some others of the authorities of Frankfort were pre-sented. Prince Metternich and the King of Bavaria dined with the Royal party. ###################################### ' Fairy,' which brought them rapidly down the river towards Cologne. They landed at Deutz, opposite Cologne, at half-past @ﬁve o'clock, and proceeded at once to the Hotel de Bellevue, where they slept. The day was remarkably @ﬁne, so that her Majesty had the best opportunity of seeing the scenery of the Rhine. Lord Adolphus Fitzclarence was waiting on board the ' Fairy,' and accompanied her Majesty. The Royal party left Cologne on Saturday morning by a special train, at a few minutes after nine o'clock, and arrived at Antwerp a little before six, where the King and Queen of the Belgians were in waiting to receive her Majesty. In the evening a grand banquet took place in the palace. Her Majesty had originally intended to dine on board the yacht, and drop down the Scheldt that even-ing, and a special messenger had been despatched from Cologne the previous evening to make the necessary arrangements. King Leopold, however, countermanded the order, taking upon himself the responsibility of assur-ing the o@@ﬃcers on board that he would prevail on the Queen to dine at the palace. At half-past seven the town was brilliantly illuminated. Along the streets tall posts were placed at intervals, surmounted by rows of lamps in the form of a pyramid the fronts of most of the houses, and all the public buildings, were also lighted up with row@ of coloured lamps. The facade of the Governor's house was one blaze of light, showing o@ﬀ very artisti-cally the fresco decorations of the arms of England and Belgium, surrounded by wreaths of @ﬂowers and gilded scrolls, which were emblazoned on the spaces between the windows. The Hotel de Ville had the whole of its vast range of windows lighted up, @ﬁve tiers of lamps run-ning from the basement story to the roof, and pouring a @ﬂood of light upon the admiring crowds in the Grand place below. The principal gate, leading to the quay, was another object of attraction it was surmounted by a pile of @ﬂags of all nations, the arms of England and Bel-gium being conspicuously displayed in the centre, stars and scrolls of gas, with the ciphers of the English and Belgian Sovereigns, were exhibited on the river front, the whole surrounded by coloured lamps, and wreaths of laurel and evergreen. The quays, however, presented the most striking and beautiful e@ﬀect. Along either bank cones of @ﬁre elevated on poles extended the whole length of the city, and in the intervals lighted torches and tar barrels cast a wild and lurid light upon the crowds who poured along the quays. The Tete de Flandres, on the opposite side of the river, was also one blaze of light, rows of lamps displaying the various lines of its batteries and entrenchments, the whole of the left bank bristled with tar and pitch barrels, around which the dark @ﬁgures of the men employed to feed the @ﬂame @were seen hovering at intervals, their @ﬁgures casting gigantic shadows across the stream. The English Government steamers, and the other vessels in the river, were also hung with lamps. The General Steam Navigation Company's steam ship ' Soho,' which was moored in the centre of the stream, opposite the Royal yacht, being conspicuous for the variety and brilliancy of its illuminations. At intervals during the night blue and red signal lights were burned, lighting up the river, the quays, and snipping with a strange and dazzling glare. Again, sheaves of rockets went roaring into the air, scattering their brilliant stars over the Scheldt, and on the deep and rapid stream below thousands of boats, from the light ski@ﬀ to the heavy lum-bering coal barge freighted with the worthy citizens of Antwerp, and carrying torches of pine in the bow and stern, @ﬂoated lo and fro, chanting their national airs in full, deep chorus, and with these were mingled the oaths, imprecations, confusion, and uproar that followed the fre-quent collisions of the river craft, the strains of military music from the banks, the hum and Babel of the many thousands who promenaded along the quays, and above all, the solemn peals of the Cathedral bells, and the roar of artillery from the citadel. At nine o'clock the Queen and her suite left the palace and proceeded through the Place de Meer, the Marché aux Souliers, by the Hotel de Ville and the Canal au Beurre to the quays, alongside which the Royal yacht was moored. The progress of the Royal party was extremely slow, in consequence of the crowded state of the streets, but it a@ﬀorded the Queen and the Prince an opportunity of viewing the illumina-tions and the other demonstrations of respect which were exhibited along their route. On approaching the Cathedral a signal was given, and instantly the whole of the magni@-ﬁcent tower was illuminated with Bengal lights. The e@ﬀect was extremely @ﬁne, every taper shaft, and pillar, carved ornament, and delicate tracery of this most beau-tiful specimen of Gothic architecture being distinctly re-vealed, and standing out like pure white marble on the dark sky. A loud burst of applause followed this magni@-ﬁcent spectacle. A few minutes, and the brilliant pa-geant was gone, and the Queen was on board the Royal yacht, which remained alongside the quay during the night. A guard of Belgian soldiers was stationed there to prevent the intrusion of the crowd, and up to a late hour the river continued crowded with boats, torches @ﬂared wildly over the heads of the revellers, or were struck upon the gunwale in tune to the music, and showered streams of @ﬁre into the hissing @ﬂood, the lights and @ﬁgures re@ﬂected and multiplied on the surface of the black and boiling current. At seven o'clock on Sunday morning the yacht got under weigh, a Royal salute was @ﬁred from the citadel, the vessels on the river were dressed out with @ﬂags, and accompanied by the ' Black Eagle,' ' Lightning,' and ' Porcupine@' Government steamers, the ' Victoria and Albert' proceeded rapidly down the Scheldt. The squad-ron reached Flushing at one o'clock, and then hove to. The Earl of Aberdeen and two others of her Majesty's suite went ashore, and made an excursion to Middleburgh, and at half-past four the squadron again got under weigh, and proceeded down the Channel with a fair wind. On Sunday, the 7th inst., her Majesty left the Scheldt, ####################################### the Royal party started by special train for Wiesbaden, and thence ###################### in carriages, where they embarked on board a ####################################################################################################################### an intimation having been previously sent to the ##################################################### King of the French that her Majesty would accept the pressing invitation of Louis Philippe to visit him en passant at the Chateau of Eu. At eight o'clock the King and Queen of the French, the Princess Adelaide, and all the members of the Royal family, arrived at Tr@éport in the grand c@har-a-banc, fol-lowed by eight or ten other carriages. The King looked better than he has done for six months. Half an hour afterwards the British steamer, with the Royal standard of England displayed, was within a mile of the shore. King Louis Philippe immediately entered a barge, with a few attendants, and proceeded to the ' Courrier' steamer, in which he approached the ' Victoria and Albert.' From the ' Courrier' his Majesty descended into a boat fully manned, and pulled to the ' Victoria and Albert.' Some little bustle took place, and then the Royal party de-scended into the barge, in which they were rowed towards the shore. In consequence, however, of its being nearly low water the barge could not land, and as the strand was distant from the road, a curious but simple expedient to obviate the di@@ﬃculty suggested itself to the King. His Majesty ordered the horse to be attached to one of the numerous large bathing machines on the strand, and by aid of it the Queen was enabled to reach the shore, a mode of travelling which very much amused the illustri-ous visitor. Planks having been laid down on the beach for the use of the Royal party, the Queen advanced to meet Queen Victoria, whom she greeted most cordially, and embraced several times. Her Majesty also kissed Prince Albert on both cheeks. The Queen of the French then presented the Princess of Salerno and the Sicilian Princesses to her Majesty, after which the whole party got into char-a-bancs, the Queen sitting next to Louis Philippe, and Prince Albert next to the Queen of the French, and proceeded to the Chateau d'Eu, amidst the cordial applause of the assembled crowds. On the arrival of the Royal party at the chateau, a splendid dejeuner was served up, which was attended by all the visitors at the chateau. After the dejeuner Louis Philippe took the opportunity of introducing the Queen to the new Vic-toria Gallery-a splendid gallery, intended to commemo-rate her Majesty's @ﬁrst visit to the Chateau d'Eu, and which is decorated with views of the principal scenes of that occasion, painted by some of the @ﬁrst painters in France. This very handsome compliment to his guest was not thrown away. Her Majesty felt greatly grati@ﬁed. In the afternoon the Royal party drove into the forest, and in the evening there was a splendid dinner at the chateau, which was attended by all the civil and military authorities of the place, as well as by the guests resident at the chateau. In the evening the Royal party attended a theatrical entertainment in the chateau, the performers of the Opera Comique having been sent for from Paris for the occasion. The performances were the ' Beau Seig-neur' and ' Richard Coeur de Lion.' On Tuesday morning the Royal party again drove in the forest in char-a-bancs, and returned to the chateau at half-past one. The Queen and Prince Albert afterwards walked in the ground attached to the palace. Shortly be-fore six in the evening her Majesty and the Prince, ac-companied by the King and Queen of the French, left the Chateau d'Eu for Tréport. A body of troops were sta-tioned in the quadrangle of the palace, and a consider-able crowd had gathered within its precincts. The vehi-cles used were the same as those for the forenoon ride. As they passed out the band played the English national anthem, and the crowd shouted Vive le Roi des Fran-çais et la Reine d'Angletaire. At six o'clock the cortège arrived at the landing-place, the bells of the church ring-ing merrily, and a distant battery of cannon @ﬁring a salute. The embarkation was speedily accomplished Louis Philippe handed the Queen on board, and the next moment the party was gliding rapidly seaward. Queen Victoria was the only lady on board the barge close to her sat the King of the French, Prince de Joinville, and Prince Albert Lord Aberdeen, M. Guizot, and Lord Liverpool, completed the party. The other members of the suite went in other boats. As the Royal barge shot past there was a tremendous rush along the jetty the steamers in the o@@ﬃng manned their yards, and the sea-ward batteries @ﬁred double royal salutes. At half-past six o'clock the Royal party were safely on board the ' Vic-toria and Albert,' and under weigh for England. The voyage across the Channel was prosperously performed-the weather continuing serene and the sea smooth. On Wednesday afternoon a telegraphic despatch from Portsmouth announced the safe arrival of her Majesty at Osborne house, in the Isle of Wight, after an absence from England of thirty-three days. THE FESTIVITIES AT PAMPELUNA. The preparations that have been made for the reception of the Queen and the Infanta of Spain and their Royal guests, the Duke and Duchess de Nemours and the Duke d'Aumale, are all on a scale of great splendour.
