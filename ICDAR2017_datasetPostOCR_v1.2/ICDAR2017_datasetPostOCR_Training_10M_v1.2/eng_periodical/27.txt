Provisionally Registered pursuant to 7 and 8 Viet. c. 110 Capital, £1,500,0 10, in 60,000 Shares of £25 each. Deposit, £l 7 . 6.1. per Share. In deference to the representations of a deputation from Leek, it has been decided that the Rugby, Derby, and Manchester Railway shall pass through Leek, in place of a branch, ns originally designed and advertised. The Rugby, Derby, and Manchester Railway is a direct line from London to Manchester, coming from London to Rugby, along the Lon don and Birmingham line, and proceeding from Rugby by Hinckley through Market Bosworth and Ashby-de la Ziuch to Derby, thence to Ashbourne, by Leek to Macclesfield, and along the Macclesfield and Stockport, and Stockport and Manchester Railways, into Manchester. A branch to Buxton is in contemplation. The principle of this railway is to obtain a direct through line between some of the most important districts in the kingdom with the least pos sible amount of new railway, and consequently the smallest expenditure of capital. It will also establish the shortest direct communication between Derby and London, Sheffield and London, and between all the towns on the North Midland Railway and London. The Manchester, Derby, and Rugby Railway will open a direct com munication between Manchester and Derby, and will considerably shorten the distance between Manchester and Nottingham and Manchester and Leicester. The line from Derby to Rugbv will establish the direct communication • fr -m that town to London, which has been so long considered desirable by the inhabitants. The same will apply to Sheffield, when the Sheffield and Chesterfield branch of the North Midland Railway is made. The great advantages of the Rugby, Derby, and Manchester Railway, through Leek, over the other projects into Manchester, among otheis, are-First. That there are only 75 miles of railway to be made in place of 189. Secondly. That it is a more direct line from London Manchester than even the proposed direct lines. Thirdly. That it interferes with no existing railway property or vested interests. Fourthly. That it passes through a district rich in manufactures, agri culture, and minerals, but which-more especially as regards its agricul tural produce, and a convenient system of intercommunication for the conveyance of that agricultural produce, to supply the large manufac turing towns in the vicinity-has been hitherto left totally without rail-wav communication. Fifthly. That it passes through the towns in its route, in place of avoiding them. Sixthly. That the whole line of railway from Rugby to Manchester will be completed and in working order within ten months from the pass ing of the Act of Parliament. Seventhly. Tha r the maps plans, estimates, and other documents re quired by the standing orders of Parliament will be lodged with the parish clerks, the clerks of the peace for the counties, and the parliamentary office , on the 10th day of November next, being twenty days within the time required by the regulations of Parliament. The report of the engineer of the Company is already completed, and will be made public in a few days, upon which a further and full pro spectus with the names of the Provisional Directory, will be published.

In deference to the representations of a deputation from Leek, it has been decided that the Rugby, Derby, and Manchester Railway shall pass through Leek, in place of a branch, ns originally designed and advertised. The Rugby, Derby, and Manchester Railway is a direct line from London to Manchester, coming from London to Rugby, along the Lon don and Birmingham line, and proceeding from Rugby by Hinckley through Market Bosworth and Ashby-de la Ziuch to Derby, thence to Ashbourne, by Leek to Macclesfield, and along the Macclesfield and Stockport, and Stockport and Manchester Railways, into Manchester. A branch to Buxton is in contemplation. The principle of this railway is to obtain a direct through line between some of the most important districts in the kingdom with the least pos sible amount of new railway, and consequently the smallest expenditure of capital. It will also establish the shortest direct communication between Derby and London, Sheffield and London, and between all the towns on the North Midland Railway and London. The Manchester, Derby, and Rugby Railway will open a direct com munication between Manchester and Derby, and will considerably shorten the distance between Manchester and Nottingham and Manchester and Leicester. The line from Derby to Rugbv will establish the direct communication • fr -m that town to London, which has been so long considered desirable by the inhabitants. The same will apply to Sheffield, when the Sheffield and Chesterfield branch of the North Midland Railway is made. The great advantages of the Rugby, Derby, and Manchester Railway, through Leek, over the other projects into Manchester, among otheis, are-First. That there are only 75 miles of railway to be made in@@@@ place of 189. Secondly. That it is a more direct line from London @@@Manchester than even the proposed direct lines. Thirdly. That it interferes with no existing railway property or vested interests. Fourthly. That it passes through a district rich in manufactures, agri culture, and minerals, but which-more especially as regards its agricul tural produce, and a convenient system of intercommunication for the conveyance of that agricultural produce, to supply the large manufac turing towns in the vicinity-has been hitherto left totally without rail-wav communication. Fifthly. That it passes through the towns in its route, in place of avoiding them. Sixthly. That the whole line of railway from Rugby to Manchester will be completed and in working order within ten months from the pass ing of the Act of Parliament. Seventhly. Tha r the maps@ plans, estimates, and other documents re quired by the standing orders of Parliament will be lodged with the parish clerks, the clerks of the peace for the counties, and the parliamentary office , on the 10th day of November next, being twenty days within the time required by the regulations of Parliament.
