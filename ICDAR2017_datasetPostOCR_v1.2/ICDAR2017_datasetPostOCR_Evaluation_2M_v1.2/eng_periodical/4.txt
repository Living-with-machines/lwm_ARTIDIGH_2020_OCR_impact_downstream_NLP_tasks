For the Birds. A pretty custom is practised in Sweden, of hanging up in frout of every house at Christmas a small sheaf of wheat for the winter provision of the birds, who, without the supply, would perish with hunger. Our own useful little spar row would gratefully remember those who would be equally mindful of his wants. Christmas Presents. The custom of making Christmas presents w § first introduced in Germany, at an uncertain period, and there, as in this country, constitute an important feature in the festivities. In Germany there is no bouse without a Christmas tree even the poorest frau manages to set up a little bunch of twigs on a box for the satisfaction of her little ones and all little German children believe that the night before Christmas the Christ Kind el comes in unseen, illuminates the tree, and puts on it and under it whatever he considers the children deserve in thc shape of gifts. The Yule Cakdlb. An ancient north country custom was the burn ing of tbe yule candle, or Christmas taper, which in ordinary houses burnt from the morning of Christmas Day until the evening, and in sonic establishments during a part of each of the twelve days.

King Frost is usually master of thc situation at Yuletide. and his compeer, darkness, has then bis period of reigu. Till the shortest day, the period of diurnal light does not exceed eight hours. The Yule Baby. Besides the Christmas customs that are common to a good many countries -such ns carol-ringing, the plum pudding, the mistletoe privilege , tho chnrcli decorations, the box, and the rest of them-there are, or were.sercral customs of more or less local interest. To this class belongs what in Durham city used to be called tbe Yule Babby On Christmas Day an old woman wac wont to go from bouse to honse seeking charity, and carrying in her arms figures representing the Virgin and Child. While waiting at tbe door ehe generally sang the favourite carol, God reat yon, merry gentlemen, aud nothing you dismay. -Little Folks. Frost Fair os nw Thames. In the year 18H, the winter was unusually severe. On tho eve of tho Epiphany a frost com menced, which continued several weeks nod during a great part nf that time the Thames waa frozen, to the indescribable distress of many in dustrious classes. A sort of rude fair was held upon the ice, to which the name of Frost Fair was given. And printing preesea were aet up there, at which was printed a memorial of the duration of the calamitous visitation. The fol lowing is a copy -'• frost fair. Amidst the arte which on thc Thames appear. To tell thc wonders of this icy year, Printing claims prior place, which at one view Erects a monument of that and you.

No one needs to be Sold what the mistletoe in, for is it not used with holly and other evergreens to decorate innumerable rooms at Christmas ? It is generally supposed to grow upon the oak but though it is found upon that tree, it is much more common upon the apple and other tree . In its universal use at Chriatmas we must trace a relic of distant days. Tho Druids, as the priests of the Celtic folk srere called, held the oak in great reverence, and performed their sacred ceremonies in oak. groves indeed, their very name ie derived from the Celtic word derv, meaning oak. For mistletoe that grew on the oak, therefore, the Druids hail a high regard. They call it in their language All-heal.'' and esteemed it of such value that when found it was cut with a golden knife by a pneot clad ia a white robe, two white hulls being offered up iu sacrifice in honour af the occasion. The fashion of kissing under tbe mistletoe at Christina , which still prevails even in the United Kingdom, is merely a modern survival of tbe ancient respect for the evergreen bough, with its berries of white.-Little Enllcs. Curistmas Chrrr. Tbe Puritans bated Christmas and Chriatmas cheer. Plum pudding and mince pies they would not eat at that sacred season, although either, they held, might be lawfully and piously eaten iu any month except Deaember. Needham, iu hit History of tbe Rebellion, sings -All plums the Prophet's son deny. And spice broths sre too hot-Treason's in a December pye, And death within tbe pot. Christmas, farewell ! thy days, I fetr-Aud merry dsya-are done So they may keep feast all tbe year. Our Saviour shall have none. The following is the recipe of the learned old Bir Roger Twysden, and is interesting as giving an idea as to the ingredients used in former times in perfecting this favourite confection ■- To Maks Mince Pye . a.d. 1630.-Takes phillet of veale or a long of mutton, and when it is parboyled, ehred it very smalle then put to it three ponnd of boefe anet. shred likewise very enialle then put to it three pound of rorintbe , well washt and pickte and one pound of sugar, beaten of nutmeg and eynnamon. of eacb balf an ounce. So put them in coffins or pye . and bake them. You muatlayo some of ye oorintbee at toppe of ye meat when they bee made, and must not, therefore, mingle them with all the rest. A Quaint Bp.rksrirb Custom. There is a pleasant Christmas custom con neeted with the parish of Cunmor, in Berkshire. On Christmas Day, after evening servioe, the parishioners who aro liable to pay any tithes repair to tbe vicarage, and are their entertained with bread, cheese, and ale. It ie no benefaction on the part of the vicar, but claimed as a right on the part of the parishioners, and even the quality of the good things which the vicar bring forward is specified. He must have four bushels of malt brewed in ale and small beer, two bushels of wheat made into bread, and half a hundredweight of cheese and what ever remains imconsumed by the tithe payers is distributed next day, after morning prayers, among the poor. Iu connection with this pariah there ie another curious custom, arising from tbe fact that Caesenton, a little dis trict on the opposite side of the Thames, was onoe a part of it. The Caasenton people had a spaco on the north side of the church net apart for their burials, and on this account paid sixpence a year to Cumuor. They had to bring their dead across the Thames at Bomerford Me le, where the plank stones they used in crossing remained Iodr after visible thence they came along a riding in Cumuor Wood, which they claimed as their churchway, beginning the psalm-singing at a par ticular spot, which marked the latter part of tba ceremonial.

The above sneaks for itself. From strict, inquiry it appears that tne benefit from using Keating s Cfcugh Lozenges is understated. The operation whs a specially severe one, and was performed by the specialist. Dr. H. T. Butliu, of Si. Bartholomew's Hospital. Since the operation the only means of relief is the use of these Li zenges. So'successful are they that one affords immediate benefit, although from the nature of the case the throat irritation is intense. WEIGHT IN GOLD.

The custom of making Christmas presents w § first introduced in Germany, at an uncertain period, and there, as in this country, constitute@ an important feature in the festivities. In Germany there is no bouse without a Christmas tree even the poorest frau manages to set up a little bunch of twigs on a box for the satisfaction of her little ones and all little German children believe that the night before Christmas the Christ Kind el comes in unseen, illuminates the tree, and puts on it and under it whatever he considers the children deserve in thc shape of gifts. The Yule Cakdlb. An ancient north country custom was the burn@ ing of tbe yule candle, or Christmas taper, which in ordinary houses burnt from the morning of Christmas Day until the evening, and in sonic establishments during a part of each of the twelve days. In Scotland and in Yorkshire candles are not uncommon trade presents, and it is not k ug since Lancashire children were expected to bring size as an offering to tlte in the Bay of Biscay, encountered a terrible gale, shipped heavy seas, sustained damage about deck several of the crew wore injured, and one man was lost overlioird.

Besides the Christmas customs that are common to a good many countries -such ns carol-ringing, the plum pudding, the mistletoe privilege , tho chnrcli decorations, the box, and the rest of them-there are, or were.sercral customs of more or less local interest.

In the year 18@H, the winter was unusually severe. On tho eve of tho Epiphany a frost com@ menced, which continued several weeks nod during a great part nf that time the Thames waa frozen, to the indescribable distress of many in@ dustrious classes. A sort of rude fair was held upon the ice, to which the name of Frost Fair was given. And printing preesea were aet up there, at which was printed a memorial of the duration of the calamitous visitation. The fol@ lowing is a copy -'• frost fair.

No one needs to be Sold what the mistletoe in, for is it not used with holly and other evergreens to decorate innumerable rooms at Christmas ? It is generally supposed to grow upon the oak but though it is found upon that tree, it is much more common upon the apple and other tree . In its universal use at Chriatmas we must trace a relic of distant days. Tho Druids, as the priests of the Celtic folk srere called, held the oak in great reverence, and performed their sacred ceremonies in oak. groves indeed, their very name ie derived from the Celtic word derv, meaning oak. For mistletoe that grew on the oak, therefore, the Druids hail a high regard. They call it in their language All-heal.'' and esteemed it of such value that when found it was cut with a golden knife by a p@neot clad ia a white robe, two white hulls being offered up iu sacrifice in honour af the occasion. The fashion of kissing under tbe mistletoe at Christina , which still prevails even in the United Kingdom, is merely a modern survival of tbe ancient respect for the evergreen bough, with its berries of white.-Little Enllcs.

So put them in coffins or pye . and bake them. You muat@layo some of ye oorintbee at toppe of ye meat when they bee made, and must not, therefore, mingle them with all the rest. A Quaint Bp.rksrirb Custom. There is a pleasant Christmas custom con@ neeted with the parish of Cunmor, in Berkshire. On Christmas Day, after evening servioe, the parishioners who aro liable to pay any tithes repair to tbe vicarage, and are their entertained with bread, cheese, and ale. It ie no benefaction on the part of the vicar, but claimed as a right on the part of the parishioners, and even the quality of the good things which the vicar bring@ forward is specified. He must have four bushels of malt brewed in ale and small beer, two bushels of wheat made into bread, and half a hundredweight of cheese and what@ ever remains imconsumed by the tithe payers is distributed next day, after morning prayers, among the poor. Iu connection with this pariah there ie another curious custom, arising from tbe fact that Caesenton, a little dis@ trict on the opposite side of the Thames, was onoe a part of it. The Caasenton people had a spaco on the north side of the church net apart for their burials, and on this account paid sixpence a year to Cumuor. They had to bring their dead across the Thames at Bomerford Me le, where the plank stones they used in crossing remained Iodr after visible thence they came along a riding in Cumuor Wood, which they claimed as their churchway, beginning the psalm-singing at a par@ ticular spot, which marked the latter part of tba ceremonial.

Besides the Christmas customs that are common to a good many countries@-such as carol-singing, the plum pudding, the mistletoe privileges, the churc@h decorations, the box, and the rest of them-there are, or were,several customs of more or less local interest. To this class belongs what in Durham city used to be called the Yule Babby. On Christmas Day an old woman was wont to go from house to house seeking charity, and carrying in her arms @ﬁgures representing the Virgin and Child. While waiting at the door she generally sang the favourite carol, God rest you, merry gentlemen, and nothing you dismay. -Little Folks. ######################## In the year 1814, the winter was unusually severe. On the eve of the Epiphany a frost com- menced, which continued several weeks and during a great part of that time the Thames was frozen, to the indescribable distress of many in- dustrions classes. A sort of rude fair was held upon the ice, to which the name of Frost Fair was given. And printing presses were set up there, at which was printed a memorial of the duration of the calamitous visitation. The fol- lowing is a copy ############### Amidst the arts which on the Thames appear, To tell the wonders of this icy year, Printing claims prior place, which at one view Erects a monument of that and you.

No one needs to be told what the mistletoe is, for is it not used with holly and other evergreens to decorate innumerable rooms at Christmas ? It is generally supposed to grow upon the oak but though it is found upon that tree, it is much more common upon the apple and other trees. In its universal use at Christmas we must trace a relic of distant days. The Druids, as the priests of the Celtic folk @were called, held the oak in great reverence, and performed their sacred ceremonies in oak@ groves indeed, their very name is derived from the Celtic word derw, meaning oak. For mistletoe that grew on the oak, therefore, the Druids ha@d a high regard. They call it in their language All-heal@@, and esteemed it of such value that when found it was cut with a golden knife by a priest clad in a white robe, two white bulls being o@ﬀered up in sacri@ﬁce in honour of the occasion. The fashion of kissing under the mistletoe at Christ@mas, which still prevails even in the United Kingdom, is merely a modern survival of the ancient respect for the evergreen bough, with its berries of white.-Little ######################## The Puritans hated Christmas and Christmas cheer.

A ######################### There is a pleasant Christmas custom con- nected with the parish of Cumnor, in Berkshire. On Christmas Day, after evening service, the parishioners who are liable to pay any tithes repair to the vicarage, and are their entertained with bread, cheese, and ale. It is no benefaction on the part of the vicar, but claimed as a right on the part of the parishioners, and even the quality of the good things which the vicar brings forward is speci@ﬁed. He must have four bushels of malt brewed in ale and small beer, two bushels of wheat made into bread, and half a hundredweight of cheese and what- ever remains unconsumed by the tithe payers is distributed next day, after morning prayers, among the poor. In connection with this parish there is another curious custom, arising from the fact that Cassenton, a little dis- trict on the opposite side of the Thames, was once a part of it. The Cassenton people had a space on the north side of the church set apart for their burials, and on this account paid sixpence a year to Cumnor. They had to bring their dead across the Thames at Somerford Me@de, where the plank stones they used in crossing remained long after visible thence they came along a riding in Cumnor Wood, which they claimed as their churchway, beginning the psalm-singing at a par- ticular spot, which marked the latter part of the ########################################## OF LOCAL STEAMERS.
