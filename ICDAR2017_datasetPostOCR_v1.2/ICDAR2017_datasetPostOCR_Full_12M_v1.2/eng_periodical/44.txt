Destruction op the Greek Fleet.-We regret to inform our readers, that Intelligence has been received in London, through the medium of the French newspapers, of a most disastrous event-no less than the total destruction of the Greek Fleet, off the Island of Scio, by the French Admiral De Rigny. No details have arrived connected with this calamitous piece of news, and we are, moreover, informed by some of the metropolitan prints, that up to a late hour on Saturday evening, Government had received no advices upon the subject. Still we fear there is little room to indulge a hope that such an event has not taken place or at least, if not totally destroyed, that the fleet of the unfortunate Greeks has actually been engaged in a ruinous conflict with the vessels under the command of the Frcncli Admiral.-It is known that the Allies had expressed their determination to compel the observance of the armistice, as well on the part of the Greeks, as of their Turkish opponents it is also known that De Rigny had sailed in the direction of Scio, to which place the Greek naval force had proceeded for the purpose of carrying on offensive operations against the Turks. We have no reason to doubt that the interference of the Allies would be prompt and decisive to force the Greeks to obey the in junction of the 24th October, and to desist from hostilities till the result of the pending negociations was known. Unless the Allies acted thus, the Sultan would have every reason to charge them with duplicity, and with being partizans of his rebellious subjects, under pretence of offering their mediation to restore peace and tranquillity.

Destruction op the Greek Fleet.-We regret to inform our readers, that Intelligence has been received in London, through the medium of the French newspapers, of a most disastrous event-no less than the total destruction of the Greek Fleet, off the Island of Scio, by the French Admiral De Rigny. No details have arrived connected with this calamitous piece of news, and we are, moreover, informed by some of the metropolitan prints, that up to a late hour on Saturday evening, Government had received no advices upon the subject. Still we fear there is little room to indulge a hope that such an event has not taken place or at least, if not totally destroyed, that the fleet of the unfortunate Greeks has actually been engaged in a ruinous conflict with the vessels under the command of the Frcncli Admiral.-It is known that the Allies had expressed their determination to compel the observance of the armistice, as well on the part of the Greeks, as of their Turkish opponents it is also known that De Rigny had sailed in the direction of Scio, to which place the Greek naval force had proceeded for the purpose of carrying on offensive operations against the Turks. We have no reason to doubt that the interference of the Allies would be prompt and decisive to force the Greeks to obey the in@ junction of the 24th October, and to desist from hostilities till the result of the pending negociations was known. Unless the Allies acted thus, the Sultan would have every reason to charge them with duplicity, and with being partizans of his rebellious subjects, under pretence of offering their mediation to restore peace and tranquillity.

No details have arrived connected with this calamitous piece of news, and we are, moreover, informed by some of the metropolitan prints, that up to a late hour on Saturday evening, Government had received no advices upon the subject, Still we fear there is little room to indulge a hope that such an event has not taken place or at least@ if not totally destroyed, that the @ﬂeet of the unfortunate Greeks has actually been engaged in a ruinous con@ﬂict with the vessels under the command of the Frenc@h Admiral.-It is known that the Allies had expressed their determination to compel the observance of the armistice, as well on the part of the Greeks, as of their Turkish opponents it is also known that DE RIGNY had sailed in the direction of Scio, to which place the Greek naval force had proceeded for the purpose of carrying on o@ﬀensive operations against the Turks. We have no reason to doubt that the interference of the Allies would be prompt and decisive to force the Greeks to obey the in- junction of the 24th October, and to desist from hostilities till the result of the pending negociations was known.
