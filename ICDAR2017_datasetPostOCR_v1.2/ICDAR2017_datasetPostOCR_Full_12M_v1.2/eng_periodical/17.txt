We now lay down to rest ourselves, and the boy soon fell asleep I was however feverish and restless, and could not close my eyes. In an hour and a half I arose, got up the horses and saddled them, and then, awaking my companion, we again pushed on by moonlight. At ten miles we crossed a well-beaten native pathway, plainly discernible even then, and this we followed down towards the cliffs, fully hoping it would lead to water. Our hopes, however, had been excited but to render our disappointment the greater, for upon tracing it onwards we found it terminate abruptly at a large circular hole of limestone rock, which would retain a considerable quantity of water after rains, but was now without a single drop. Gloomily turning away we again pushed on for eight miles further, and at three in the morning of the 10th were compelled to halt from downright exhaustion and fatigue. The horses and sheep were knocked up. The poor boy was so tired and sleepy that he could scarcely sit upon his horse, and I found myself actually dosing as I walked mechanically my legs kept moving forwards, but my eves were every now and then closed in forgetfulness of all around me, until I was suddenly thrown down by get ting entangled amongst the scrub, or aroused by a severe blow across the face from the recoil of a bough after the passage of the boy's horse. I now judged we had come about ninety-three miles from Yeerkum-ban-kauwe, and hoped that we could not be very far from water. Having tied up the horses for an hour or two, and without making a fire, or even unrolling our cloaks to cover us, we stretched eurselveaon the ground, and were in a few moments fast asleep. . March 10.-At five we were again on our route, every moment expecting to see a break in the line of cliffs along which we had now travelled so far. Alas ! they still con tinued stretching as far as the eye could see to the west ward, and as fast as we arrived at one point which had bounded our vision and beyond which we hoped a change might occur , it was but to be met with the view of another beyond. Distressing and fatal as the continuance of these cliffs might prove to us, there was a grandeur and sub limity in their appearance that was most imposing, and which struck me with admiration. Stretching out before us in lofty unbroken outline, they presented the singular and romantic appearance of massy battlements of masonry, gupported by huge buttresses, and glittering in the morn ing sun which had now risen upon them, and made the scene beautiful even amidst the dangers and anxieties of our situation. In a direct line of upwards of 800 miles thus gone over by Mr Eyre, there does not seem to have been a watercourse, or a hollow of any kind, crossed and not a drop of fresh water accessible on the surface. It could only be obtained by dig ging close to the sea-shore, or the sand-liills of the coast and even by that means was often not pro curable for distances of 160 miles together. The dreary waste is described by Mr Eyre as an almost uniform table land of fossil formation, with an ele vation of from three to five hundred feet covered for the most part by dense impenetrable scrubs, and only varied on its surface by occasional sandy or rocky undulations. The dangers and sufferings of travel in such a region may be conceived as well as its generally uninteresting character. But every now and then a startling little trait occurs which gives the living touch of reality to the scene and again carries the reader forward, watchful and anxious for the traveller. In the following for instance. . . . I occupied myself in writing and charting during the day, and at night amused myself in taking stellar obser vations for latitude. I had already taken the altitude of Vega, and deduced the latitude to be 32 deg. 3 min. 23 sec. S. leaving my artificial horizon on the ground outside whilst I remained in the tent waiting until Altair came to the meri dian, I then took my sextant and went out to observe this star also but upon putting down my hand to take hold of the horizon-glass in order to wipe the dew off, my fingers went into the quicksilver-the horizon-glass was gone, and also the piece of canvas I had put on the ground to lie down upon whilst observing so low an altitude as that of Vega. Searching a little more, I missed a spade, a parcel of horse shoes, an axe, a tin dish, some ropes, a grubbing-hoe, and several smaller things which had been left outside the tent, as not being likely to take any injury from the damp. It was evident I was surrounded bv natives, who had stolen all these things during the short time I had been in my tent, certainly not exceeding half an hour. The night was very windy, and I had heard nothing besides, I was encamped in the midst of a very dense brush of large wide-spreading tea-trees and other bushes, any of which would afford a screen for a considerable number of natives. In daylight it was impossible to see many yards in distance, and nothing could be discerned at night. ... As soon as I missed my horizon-glass, and entertained the suspicion of natives being about, I hurried into the tent, and lighting a large blue light, run with it rapidly through the bushes around me. The effect of this was very beauti ful amidst the darkness and gloom of the woods, and for a great distance in every direction objects could be seen as well as by day the natives, however, were gone and I could only console myself by firing a couple of balls after them through the underwood, to warn them of the danger of intruding upon me again. I then put everything which had been left outside into the tent, and kept watch for an hour or two but my visitors came no more. . . . Rising very early, I set to work with an axe to clear away the hushes from around my tent. I now discovered that the natives had been concealed behind a large tea-tree not twenty yarifs from the tent there were numerous foot-marks there, and the remains of fire-sticks which they had brought with them, for a native rarely moves at night with out fire. treatise or dissertation at the close of his work. The reader interested in the subject will find his information curious and ample. The matters treated of embrace not only the physical and moral state of the aborigines their habits of life, rude government, and social relations their language and dialects but also very interesting notices of he effects of their contact with Europeans, and some valuable suggestions for an improvement in the system generally adopted towards them. Our extracts are limited by our space but to even readers familiar with Captain Grey's excellent dissertations, much of Mr Eyre's information will be new and original. husband and wife. Wives are considered the absolute property of the hus band, and can be given away, or exchanged, or lent, ac cording to his caprice. A husband is denominated in the Adelaide dialect, Yongarra, Martanya the owner or pro prietor of a wile . Female children are betrothed usually from early infancy, and such arrangements are usually ad hered to still in many cases circumstances occur frequently to cause an alteration but if not, the girls generally go to live with their husbands about the age of twelve, and some times even before that. Relatives nearer than cousins are not allowed to marry, and this alliance does not generally take place Female orphans belong to the nearest male re lative, as also does a widow', instead of to the nearest male relative of the husband, as was found to be the case in Western Australia by Captain Grey. Two or three months generally elapse before the widow goes to another hus band but if the wife dies, the man takes another as soon as he can get one. If a woman, having young children, join another tribe, the children go with her but I am not aware whether they would remain permanently attached to that tribe or not. Brothers often barter their sisters for wives for themselves, but it can only be done with the parents' consent, or after their death. If a wife be stolen, war is always continued until she is given up, or another female in her place. There is no ceremony connected with the undertaking of marriage. In those cases where I have witnessed the giving away of a wife, the woman was simply ordered by the nearest male relative in whose disposal she was, to take up her ' rocko,' the bag in which a female carries the effects of her husband, and go to the man's camp to whom she had been given. Marriage is not looked upon as any pledge of chastity, indeed no such virtue is recognised. But little real affection consequently exists between husbands and wives, and young men value a wife principally for her ser vices as a slave in fact, when asked why they are anxious to obtain wives, their usual reply is, that they may get wood, water, and food for them, and carry whatever pro perty they possess. NATIVE MODESTY. Innate propriety of behaviour is also frequently exhi bited by the Aborigines in their natural state, in the modest unasuming manner in which they take their positions to observe what is going on, and in a total absence of any thing that is rude oroffensive. It is true that the reverse of this is also often to be met with but I think it will usually be found that it is among natives who have before been in contact with Europeans, or where familiarities have been used with them first, or an injudicious system of treat ment has been adopted towards them. Delicacy of feeling is not often laid to the charge of the Aborigines, and yet I was witness to a singular instance of it at King George's Sound. I was looking one evening at the natives dancing, and who were, as they always are on these occasions, in a state of complete nudity. In the midst of the performance, one ol the natives standing by as a spectator, mentioned that a white woman was passing up the road and although this was some little distance away, and the night was tolerably dark, they all with one accord crossed over to the bushes where their cloaks were, put them on, and resumed their amusement. joke of their own, which is much more remarkable for its dullness than for any more lady-like quality. LYCEUM. An excellent new farce was played here on Mon day night better than any piece of its class which I we have seen for many a day. It has nicety of ' character, and a good broad humour. You laugh, and have no need to be ashamed f your mirth. There is neither caricature nor coarseness. We cannot stay to tell the plot which'is a plot, and not told without some pains , but must briefly counsel the playgoer to see Peter Jenkins. Mr and Mrs Keeley, Mr Wigan and Mr Meadows, complete an admirable cast. Mr Keeley is not only an honest truth-telling fellow forced to tell lies for a friend but a confirmed little bachelor, caught, willy-nilly, in the snares of matrimony. His dilemmas are intense, and he does justice to them. FOREIGN NEWS. Some representations of native ornaments, wea-pons, and implements and works of industry, in this part of the book, are useful to the text. THE THEATRICAL EXAMINER. Mr Eyre seems to have no hope, in spite of Capt. Sturt's cheering dispatches, that any inland sea will ever be ultimately discovered behind this vast unpromising table land. Can it be, he asks, that the whole is one immense interminable desert, or an alternation of deserts and shallow lakes ? Incidental to the narrative of the expeditions are many illustrations of native character but Mr Eyre, as vie before said, has collected all hi. mnnv years HAYMARKET. The False Mr Pope is a retired Hammersmith tradesman of about five feet four, with a Ramilie wig and tail more than half as big as himself, square-cut buckram skirts, long flapped white waistcoat, and minute three-cornered hat, who is passed off by a wag of a player upon a party of petticoat admirers of Pope, for the celebrated au thor of the Dunciad. To fancy Mr Buckstone in this predicament, is to have a very clear notion of Mr Peake's amusing farce, It is nicely presented with abundance of pe ruke for the gentlemen, and of hoods, clustering curls, cardinals, and little china, for the ladies and it perpetrates avast many abominable jokes, which nobody but the actors and actresses can possibly be expected to laugh at. But this is the moral. The ladies are in such a state of frantic foregone admiration of Mr Pope, that the more audacious the flights of Mr Buckstone the wittier they are taken to be and though this is rather a danger ous experiment for a farce, the audience help it ont with their good-nature. Indeed it would take a troublesome amount of the other quality to withstand Mr Buckstone's practical points of drollery. When he takes OS' his wig in a sudden heat, for example, and exposes his small bald head, Swift's mouse under a canopy of state is nothing to it. When he effects a series of practical Rapes of the Lock, too, he uses the scissors like a true poet. And when he passes from doing to suffering, tastes the griefs as well as glories of fame, and is well thrashed by Mr Curb's chairman as he leaves the player's house,-the act closed with a roar.

M. Royer Collard had been President of the Chamber of De puties, Member of the French Academy, and Professor of Philosophy at the College of France. The Slave Trade Convention.- The vessels in tended to act against the slave trade are not, says the ' Constitutionnel,' yet ready to proceed to the coasts of Africa. They are not to set out for six weeks or two months. Meanwhile communications are exchanged with England every day on the subject of the mission which the two navies are to fulfil together. Recently the Ad miralty has drawn up regulations for day and night sig nals, which the English and French cruisers are to make use of, in order to mutually recognise each other. It ap pears that we have approved of all the dispositions of these regulations. It is divided into two parts the first concerning sailing vessels, and the other steamers. The English navy lias been long occupied for its own use with a regulation of this kind for steamers, collisions of which are both frequent and dangerous. In France, nothing has been done in that respect. Rumoured Retirement of Marshal Soult.-A letter from Castres announces that the Marquis de Mor-nay has just arrived at Soultberg. If report can be be lieved, the marquis, who was at Beauvais for the Council-General, quitted that town precipitately, in consequence of a pressing invitation from the Minister of War. The old marshal, who declares himself exceedingly fatigued with the struggles and difficulties which he has to en counter, particularly from Algeria, and who is besides tormented with a chronic cough, again talks of withdraw ing from office but, as to withdraw at his age is to give up public affairs for ever, he is unwilling, he says, to take such a determination without consulting his family. The ' France ' discredits the report of the Marshal's retirement. Visit of the French Princes to the Queen of Spain.-On the 3rd inst., the Duke and Duchess de Ne mours and the Duke d'Aumale, after visiting Biarritz and St Jean de Luz, arrived at the bridge which unites France with Spain. There the Princes alighted from their carriages and crossed the bridge on foot, accompa nied by Count Bresson, the Euench Ambassador, the Pre fect of the Department of the Lower Pyrenees M. Aze-vedo Gen. Boyer, Aid-de-Camp of the Duke de Ne mours Col. Jamin, Aid-de-Camp of the Duke d'Aumale, c. On reaching the Spanish territory they were com plimented by the Duke de San Carlos, a nobleman of the Queen's Bedchamber, and Senor Arana, Master of the Ceremonies of the Palace, in the name of the Queen, and by Senors Olozabal and Aldamar, in that of the province of Guipuzcoa. Gen. Barrenechea, commander of the pro vince, received the French Princes at the head of the troops with all the honours due to their rank. The people, on their side, loudly cheered them. The august party slept at Tolosa, and entered Pampeluna on the following day. Accounts from Bayonne of the 8th state that they had returned to that town in good health, highly satisfied with the reception given them, not only at Pampeluna, but along the whole of their journey in Spain. The Duke d Aumale travelled back through the valley of Bastan on horseback. Future Residence of Don Carlos.-The ' Consti-tutionnel' says - The Marquis de Villafranca is hourly expected at Paris. He comes to solicit, it is said, autho risation for Don Carlos and the Princess to proceed to Rome, the climate of Bourges being injurious to the health of the Princess, who was born in Brazil. If M. de Villafranca does not obtain passports for Italy, he is directed to demand from the French Government per mission for Don Carlos and the Princess to fix their resi dence in such town of the south as they may choose. The Pofe's Sentiments towards France.- The ' Journal des Debats ' states that on the occasion of the celebration of the fetes of St Louis in the French church at Rome, the Pope and a considerable number of cardinals attended. M. Rossi, the French Plenipotentiary, opened the door of the carriage at the church door, and thanked his Holiness for the honour he had deigned to confer on the French church. The Pope, in a voice so loud that lie could be heard by the crowd assembled around him, replied that he had great pleasure in performing the pious duty, and that he should be happy that that expression of his senti ments were known to the King of the French. Alter prayers, his Holiness retired to an adjoining apartment, where the ceremony of kissing his toe was gone t noug l by all the natives of France that presented themselves. GERMANY.

[ GS_aligned] ################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################# the dry and withered grass around us. We now lay down to rest ourselves, and the boy soon fell asleep I was however feverish and restless, and could not close my eyes. In an hour and a half I arose, got up the horses and saddled them, and then, awaking my companion, we again pushed on by moonlight. At ten miles we crossed a well‐beaten native pathway, plainly discernible even then, and this we followed down towards the cli@ﬀs, fully hoping it would lead to water. Our hopes, however, had been excited but to render our disappointment the greater, for upon tracing it onwards we found it terminate abruptly at a large circular hole of limestone rock, which would retain a considerable quantity of water after rains, but was now without a single drop. Gloomily turning away we again pushed on for eight miles further, and at three in the morning of the 10th were compelled to halt from downright exhaustion and fatigue. The horses and sheep were knocked up. The poor boy was so tired and sleepy that he could scarcely sit upon his horse, and I found myself actually dosing as I walked mechanically my legs kept moving forwards, but my eyes were every now and then closed in forgetfulness of all around me, until I was suddenly thrown down by get- ting entangled amongst the scrub, or aroused by a severe blow across the face from the recoil of a bough after the passage of the boy's horse. I now judged we had come about ninety‐three miles from Yeerkum‐ban‐kauwe, and hoped that we could not be very far from water. Having tied up the horses for an hour or two, and without making a @ﬁre, or even unrolling our cloaks to cover us, we stretched ourselves on the ground, and were in a few moments fast asleep. @@March 10.-At @ﬁve we were again on our route, every moment expecting to see a break in the line of cli@ﬀs along which we had now travelled so far. Alas ! they still con- tinued stretching as far as the eye could see to the west- ward, and as fast as we arrived at one point which had bounded our vision and beyond which we hoped a change might occur , it was but to be met with the view of another beyond. Distressing and fatal as the continuance of these cli@ﬀs might prove to us, there was a grandeur and sub- limity in their appearance that was most imposing, and which struck me with admiration. Stretching out before us in lofty unbroken outline, they presented the singular and romantic appearance of massy battlements of masonry, supported by huge buttresses, and glittering in the morn- ing sun which had now risen upon them, and made the scene beautiful even amidst the dangers and anxieties of our situation. In a direct line of upwards of 800 miles thus gone over by Mr Eyre, there does not seem to have been a watercourse, or a hollow of any kind, crossed and not a drop of fresh water accessible on the surface. It could only be obtained by dig- ging close to the sea‐shore, or the sand@‐hills of the coast and even by that means was often not pro- curable for distances of 160 miles together. The dreary waste is described by Mr Eyre as an almost uniform table land of fossil formation, with an ele- vation of from three to @ﬁve hundred feet covered for the most part by dense impenetrable scrubs, and only varied on its surface by occasional sandy or rocky undulations. The dangers and su@ﬀerings of travel in such a region may be conceived as well as its generally uninteresting character. But every now and then a startling little trait occurs which gives the living touch of reality to the scene and again carries the reader forward, watchful and anxious for the traveller. In the following for instance. . . . I occupied myself in writing and charting during the day, and at night amused myself in taking stellar obser- vations for latitude. I had already taken the altitude of Vega, and deduced the latitude to be 32 deg. 3 min. 23 sec. S. leaving my arti@ﬁcial horizon on the ground outside whilst I remained in the tent waiting until Altair came to the meri- dian, I then took my sextant and went out to observe this star also but upon putting down my hand to take hold of the horizon‐glass in order to wipe the dew o@ﬀ, my @ﬁngers went into the quicksilver-the horizon‐glass was gone, and also the piece of canvas I had put on the ground to lie down upon whilst observing so low an altitude as that of Vega. Searching a little more, I missed a spade, a parcel of horse- shoes, an axe, a tin dish, some ropes, a grubbing‐hoe, and several smaller things which had been left outside the tent, as not being likely to take any injury from the damp. It was evident I was surrounded by natives, who had stolen all these things during the short time I had been in my tent, certainly not exceeding half an hour. The night was very windy, and I had heard nothing besides, I was encamped in the midst of a very dense brush of large wide‐spreading tea‐trees and other bushes, any of which would a@ﬀord a screen for a considerable number of natives. In daylight it was impossible to see many yards in distance, and nothing could be discerned at night. . . . As soon as I missed my horizon‐glass, and entertained the suspicion of natives being about. I hurried into the tent, and lighting a large blue light, run with it rapidly through the bushes around me. The e@ﬀect of this was very beauti- ful amidst the darkness and gloom of the woods, and for a great distance in every direction objects could be seen as well as by day the natives, however, were gone and I could only console myself by @ﬁring a couple of balls after them through the underwood, to warn them of the danger of intruding upon me again. I then put everything which had been left outside into the tent, and kept watch for an hour or two but my visitors came no more. . . . Rising very early, I set to work with an axe to clear away the bushes from around my tent. I now discovered that the natives had been concealed behind a large tea‐tree not twenty yar@ds from the tent there were numerous foot- marks there, and the remains of @ﬁre‐sticks which they had brought with them, for a native rarely moves at night with- out ################################################################################# the subject will @ﬁnd his information curious and ample. The matters treated of embrace not only the physical and moral state of the aborigines their habits of life, rude government, and social relations their language and dialects but also very interesting notices of the e@ﬀects of their contact with Europeans, and some valuable suggestions for an improvement in the system generally adopted towards them. Our extracts are limited by our space but to even readers familiar with Captain Grey's excellent dissertations, much of Mr Eyre's information will be new and original. ################# Wives are considered the absolute property of the hus- band, and can be given away, or exchanged, or lent, ac- cording to his caprice. A husband is denominated in the Adelaide dialect, Yongarra, Martanya the owner or pro- prietor of a wife . Female children are betrothed usually from early infancy, and such arrangements are usually ad- hered to still in many cases circumstances occur frequently to cause an alteration but if not, the girls generally go to live with their husbands about the age of twelve, and some- times even before that. Relatives nearer than cousins are not allowed to marry, and this alliance does not generally take place Female orphans belong to the nearest male re- lative, as also does a widow@, instead of to the nearest male relative of the husband, as was found to be the case in Western Australia by Captain Grey. Two or three months generally elapse before the widow goes to another hus- band but if the wife dies, the man takes another as soon as he can get one. If a woman, having young children, join another tribe, the children go with her but I am not aware whether they would remain permanently attached to that tribe or not. Brothers often barter their sisters for wives for themselves, but it can only be done with the parents' consent, or after their death. If a wife be stolen, war is always continued until she is given up, or another female in her place. There is no ceremony connected with the undertaking of marriage. In those cases where I have witnessed the giving away of a wife, the woman was simply ordered by the nearest male relative in whose disposal she was, to take up her ' rocko,' the bag in which a female carries the e@ﬀects of her husband, and go to the man's camp to whom she had been given. Marriage is not looked upon as any pledge of chastity, indeed no such virtue is recognised. But little real a@ﬀection consequently exists between husbands and wives, and young men value a wife principally for her ser- vices as a slave in fact, when asked why they are anxious to obtain wives, their usual reply is, that they may get wood, water, and food for them, and carry whatever pro- perty they possess. NATIVE MODESTY. Innate propriety of behaviour is also frequently exhi- bited by the Aborigines in their natural state, in the modest unasuming manner in which they take their positions to observe what is going on, and in a total absence of any- thing that is rude or oﬀensive. It is true that the reverse of this is also often to be met with but I think it will usually be found that it is among natives who have before been in contact with Europeans, or where familiarities have been used with them @ﬁrst, or an injudicious system of treat- ment has been adopted towards them. Delicacy of feeling is not often laid to the charge of the Aborigines, and yet I was witness to a singular instance of it at King George's Sound. I was looking one evening at the natives dancing, and who were, as they always are on these occasions, in a state of complete nudity. In the midst of the performance, one of the natives standing by as a spectator, mentioned that a white woman was passing up the road and although this was some little distance away, and the night was tolerably dark, they all with one accord crossed over to the bushes where their cloaks were, put them on, and resumed their amusement. ################################################ for its dullness than for any more lady‐like quality. LYCEUM. An excellent new farce was played here on Mon- day night better than any piece of its class which @@we have seen for many a day. It has nicety of@@ character, and a good broad humour. You laugh, and have no need to be ashamed of your mirth. There is neither caricature nor coarseness. We cannot stay to tell the plot which is a plot, and not told without some pains , but must brie@ﬂy counsel the playgoer to see Peter Jenkins. Mr and Mrs Keeley, Mr Wigan and Mr Meadows, complete an admirable cast. Mr Keeley is not only an honest truth‐telling fellow forced to tell lies for a friend but a con@ﬁrmed little bachelor, caught, willy‐nilly, in the snares of matrimony. His dilemmas are intense, and he does justice to them. FOREIGN ######################################################### and implements and works of industry, in this part of the book, are useful to the text. THE THEATRICAL EXAMINER. Mr Eyre seems to have no hope, in spite of Capt. Sturt's cheering dispatches, that any inland sea will ever be ultimately discovered behind this vast unpromising table land. Can it be, he asks, that the whole is one immense interminable desert, or an alternation of deserts and shallow lakes ? Incidental to the narrative of the expeditions are many illustrations of native character but Mr Eyre, as @we before said, has collected all his many ########################################################### tradesman of about @ﬁve feet four, with a Ramilie wig and tail more than half as big as himself, square‐cut buckram skirts, long @ﬂapped white waistcoat, and minute three‐cornered hat, who is passed o@ﬀ by a wag of a player upon a party of petticoat admirers of Pope, for the celebrated au- thor of the Dunciad. To fancy Mr Buckstone in this predicament, is to have a very clear notion of Mr Peake's amusing farce. It is nicely presented with abundance of pe- ruke for the gentlemen, and of hoods, clustering curls, cardinals, and little china, for the ladies and it perpetrates a vast many abominable jokes, which nobody but the actors and actresses can possibly be expected to laugh at. But this is the moral. The ladies are in such a state of frantic foregone admiration of Mr Pope, that the more audacious the @ﬂights of Mr Buckstone the wittier they are taken to be and though this is rather a danger- ous experiment for a farce, the audience help it ont with their good‐nature. Indeed it would take a troublesome amount of the other quality to withstand Mr Buckstone's practical points of drollery. When he takes o@ﬀ his wig in a sudden heat, for example, and exposes his small bald head. Swift's mouse under a canopy of state is nothing to it. When he e@ﬀects a series of practical Rapes of the Lock, too, he uses the scissors like a true poet. And when he passes from doing to su@ﬀering, tastes the griefs as well as glories of fame, and is well thrashed by Mr Curll's chairman as he leaves the player's house,-the act closed with a roar. There should have been no second. There is nothing but stale repetition in ################################################################################################################################################### DEATH ######################### illustrious citizen died on the 4th inst., at his estate at Chateauvieux, near Saint‐Aignan, in the 82nd year of his age.

The old marshal, who declares himself exceedingly fatigued with the struggles and di@@ﬃculties which he has to en- counter, particularly from Algeria, and who is besides tormented with a chronic cough, again talks of withdraw- ing from o@@ﬃce but, as to withdraw at his age is to give up public a@ﬀairs for ever, he is unwilling, he says, to take such a determination without consulting his family.
