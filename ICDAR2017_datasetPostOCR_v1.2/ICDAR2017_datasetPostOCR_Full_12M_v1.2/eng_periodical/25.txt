LOSS OF TEETH SUPPLIED WITHOUT SPRINGS, CLASP . OR WIRES, LOOSE TEETH FASTENED, AND KILLING DECAYED TEETH WITH MINERAL MARMORATUM. MONS. LE DRAY and SON, SURGEON-i'-L DENTISTS, 42 BERNERS STREET, OXFORD STREET, continue to restore decayed Teeth with their celebrated Mineral Mar moratum, so universally recommended by the Faculty of England, France, and throughout the Continent, which substance they are the sole inventors and possessors of. The operation is performed without the least pain it is placed into the cavity in an almost liquid state, and in a few seconds hardens into enamel, preventing and curing the Tooth-ache, arresting all further progress of decay, allaying in one minute the most excruciating pain, and rendering the operation of extraction unnecessary. They also fasten loose 'leech, particularly of aged persons, whether arising from neglect, the use of calomel, disease of the gums, or any other cause. LOSS OF TEETH. Mons. LE DRAY continues to SUPPLY THE LOSS OF TEETH, from one to a complete set, without springs or wires, upon his new system of SELF-ADHESION, which has procured him such universal approbation, and is recommended by numerous physicians and surgeons as being the most ingenious system of supplying artificial teeth hitherto invented. They adapt themselves over the most tender gums or remain ing stumps without causing the least pain, rendering the operation of extracting quite unnecessary. They are so fixed as to fasten any loose teeth where the gums have shrunk, from the use of calomel or other causes. He also begs to invite those not liking to undergo any painful operation, as practised by most members of the profession, to inspect his painless yet effective system and in order that his improvements may be within the reach of the most economical, he will continue the same mo derate charges. There is no disease, to which the mouth i3 liable, more destructive than Scurvy in the Gums, the loss of teeth is more to be attributed to it than any other cause, for it is the primary source of decay in them. On its first appearance the Gums bleed on the most trifling occasion, become spongy and lose that firm texture they have in a healthy state, causing the breath to be offensive and repulsive to every one under its influence, besides other evils repugnant to a sensitive and refined mind. It muse be a source of extreme gratification to those thus afflicted to be assured that Mons. LE DRAY can effectually remove this destructive complaint by a single application, and without the least pain. Artificial Teeth out of repair, re-modelled to fit the mouth, and re stored, equal in beauty and durability to their original state. At home every day from Ten till Six. Mons.

LOSS OF TEETH SUPPLIED WITHOUT SPRINGS, CLASP . OR WIRES, LOOSE TEETH FASTENED, AND KILLING DECAYED TEETH WITH MINERAL MARMORATUM. M@ONS. LE DRAY and SON, SURGEON-i'-L DENTISTS, 42 BERNERS STREET, OXFORD STREET, continue to restore decayed Teeth with their celebrated Mineral Mar@ moratum, so universally recommended by the Faculty of England, France, and throughout the Continent, which substance they are the sole inventors and possessors of. The operation is performed without the least pain it is placed into the cavity in an almost liquid state, and in a few seconds hardens into enamel, preventing and curing the Tooth-ache, arresting all further progress of decay, allaying in one minute the most excruciating pain, and rendering the operation of extraction unnecessary. They also fasten loose 'leech, particularly of aged persons, whether arising from neglect, the use of calomel, disease of the gums, or any other cause. LOSS OF TEETH. Mons. LE DRAY continues to SUPPLY THE LOSS OF TEETH, from one to a complete set, without springs or wires, upon his new system of SELF-ADHESION, which has procured him such universal approbation, and is recommended by numerous physicians and surgeons as being the most ingenious system of supplying artificial teeth hitherto invented. They adapt themselves over the most tender gums or remain@ ing stumps without causing the least pain, rendering the operation of extracting quite unnecessary. They are so fixed as to fasten any loose teeth where the gums have shrunk, from the use of calomel or other causes. He also begs to invite those not liking to undergo any painful operation, as practised by most members of the profession, to inspect his painless yet effective system and in order that his improvements may be within the reach of the most economical, he will continue the same mo@ derate charges. There is no disease, to which the mouth i3 liable, more destructive than Scurvy in the Gums, the loss of teeth is more to be attributed to it than any other cause, for it is the primary source of decay in them. On its first appearance the Gums bleed on the most trifling occasion, become spongy and lose that firm texture they have in a healthy state, causing the breath to be offensive and repulsive to every one under its influence, besides other evils repugnant to a sensitive and refined mind. It muse be a source of extreme gratification to those thus afflicted to be assured that Mons. LE DRAY can effectually remove this destructive complaint by a single application, and without the least pain. Artificial Teeth out of repair, re-modelled to fit the mouth, and re@ stored, equal in beauty and durability to their original state. At home every day from Ten till Six. Mons.

LE DRAY and SON, SURGEON@@@-@ DENTISTS, 42 BERNERS STREET, OXFORD STREET, continue to restore decayed Teeth with their celebrated Mineral Mar- moratum, so universally recommended by the Faculty of England, France, and throughout the Continent, which substance they are the sole inventors and possessors of. The operation is performed without the least pain it is placed into the cavity in an almost liquid state, and in a few seconds hardens into enamel, preventing and curing the Tooth-ache, arresting all further progress of decay, allaying in one minute the most excruciating pain, and rendering the operation of extraction unnecessary. They also fasten loose @Teeth, particularly of aged persons, whether arising from neglect, the use of calomel, disease of the gums, or any other cause. LOSS OF TEETH. Mons. LE DRAY continues to SUPPLY THE LOSS OF TEETH, from one to a complete set, without springs or wires, upon his new system of SELF-ADHESION, which has procured him such universal approbation, and is recommended by numerous physicians and surgeons as being the most ingenious system of supplying arti@ﬁcial teeth hitherto invented. They adapt themselves over the most tender gums or remain- ing stumps without causing the least pain, rendering the operation of extracting quite unnecessary. They are so @ﬁxed as to fasten any loose teeth where the gums have shrunk, from the use of calomel or other causes. He also begs to invite those not liking to undergo any painful operation, as practised by most members of the profession, to inspect his painless yet e@ﬀective system and in order that his improvements may be within the reach of the most economical, he will continue the same mo- derate charges. There is no disease, to which the mouth is liable, more destructive than Scurvy in the Gums, the loss of teeth is more to be attributed to it than any other cause, for it is the primary source of decay in them. On its @ﬁrst appearance the Gums bleed on the most tri@ﬂing occasion, become spongy and lose that @ﬁrm texture they have in a healthy state, causing the breath to be o@ﬀensive and repulsive to every one under its in@ﬂuence, besides other evils repugnant to a sensitive and re@ﬁned mind. It must be a source of extreme grati@ﬁcation to those thus a@@ﬄicted to be assured that Mons. LE DRAY can e@ﬀectually remove this destructive complaint by a single application, and without the least pain. Arti@ﬁcial Teeth out of repair, re-modelled to @ﬁt the mouth, and re- stored, equal in beauty and durability to their original state. At home every day from Ten till Six. Mons.
