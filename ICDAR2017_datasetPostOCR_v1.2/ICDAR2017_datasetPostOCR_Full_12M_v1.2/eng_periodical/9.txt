Junes Csnbun Read, popularly known as the Southend murderer, was executed at Chelmsford on Tuesday. About half-pa t seven the Under-Sheriff Sir. Gepp drore up with his quaintly-attired marshal on the box of the eoach, and a moment after wards the prison bell began to toll at short intervals. The two reporters who were to represent the public entered with the Under-Sheriff, and ten minutes of suspense were spent in the Governor's room in hushed con versation. Billington, who came to Chelms ford from London at half-past three on Monday and bad slept at the gaol, came in harriedly for some final instructions, and a moment later the gaol surgeon Dr. E. Hunt Carter was sent for. He was only absent for a minnte or two, and remarked on his return that the convict had asked for a stimulant, and had been given some branny, his chief anxiety, however, being as to the quickness and painlessness of his end. Dr. Carter assured him that he would feel nothing whatever, and Read appeared to be satisfied. Before this breakfast-a plain one, of bread and butter-bad been e.Ven in the presence of the Chaplain, who said that Read was very grateful to him, and soem-d to pay attention to his ministrations The culprit had also slept well. Two or three minutes more an-' the Under-Sheriff and the Chaplain - H' e latter in his black gown-went down a few steps to the great central hexagon of the prison. Billington-A UTILE MAN IN A LIGHT SUIT, and wearing a light travelling cap-was already there,and at two minutes before eight entered the door of the first cell in one of the pass.ges Read appeared to be prepared. He was wearing the light grey clothes which he had on at the trial, ,md on his head was a light cap like that of the executioner. Mr. Gepp asked for the last time if he had anything to say. He replied that be had only to thank the governor and all the officials for their continued kindness ever since he had been in the gaol. His beard was black and bushy. He was wearing a white collar which should have buttoned at tho back of tho neck, but was left open there, and as he passed from the cell into the central hall and thence into the open air he was supported by warders, bat their help seemed needless, f r he walked firmlv and looked resolute, though his face was pale and his pinioned hands twiched convulsively behind him. As the bell struck a further knell the Chaplain began to read the Burial bervice-• I am the resurrection and the life, and the warders outside fell in behind the little procession. It was only a step or two to the foot of the gallows - a ponderous cross erected in a little shed. Read, though stoutly built, is really a little man weighing just under nine stone, and a drop of 7ft 8ln was allowed. Quietly enough he took his place ou the trapdoor placing bis feet where Billington directed. Almost before tho last on tho warders had made his way through the narrow doorway all w g over. Across the drop a couple of blaok-palnted planks were laid, and on these the stalwart ward r who held the slight criminal by the left arm took bis stand, but even then the support appeared to he unnecessary for Read held himself as if somebody else rather than he were chiefly concerned, and only muttered to Billington in an undertone, Button my coat. These were HI8 LAST WORDS. The executioner pinioned the convict's feet the arms had been fastened in the cell-snatched off and droped upon the scaffold the cap which Read had been wearing, and adjusted the noose with what sounds like a murmured word of apology. The piece of rubber which keeps the knot in position was at once drawn tight, tf o white cap was ont of Billington s pocket and over Read's head, and then almost before those in the shed knew that the end had come the executioner stepped lightly to the lever and rested upon it for a moment. The trapdoore parted and Read's body diopptd plnmb to swing round in sickening fashion at the end of the rope eight feet below. A twitch or two of the limbs was noticed, but these, the dootor assured those present, were only due to the reflex notion of the muscles, and the neck had bssn broken, deatn consequently being Immediate and painless. Round and round tbc ghastly figure swung as the little party retired only a warder or two an 5 Billington being le.t near the corpse while it hung duringtl.e specified hour prior to the inquest, BEAD MADE NO CONFESSION. He died as lie had lived during these latter weeks, protesting his innocence to his family, and declining to say anything at ail to the gaol suthorilies. Subsequently an inquest was held on the body, and the usual formal verdict was returned. Read's last, letter, written a few hours before his death, was as follows -H.M. Prison, Chelmsford, Dec. 2nd, 1£94 Dear Harry,-In spite of the truth nd in dehince of the eviflenco presented to him proving my innocence, the Home Secretary has endorsed the murderous conspiracy of his professional brethren.

My mouth thus being sealed, I have beforehand referred him i,o the medical eviderce, which showed that the girl was murdered between twelve midnight 24 6 uni 25 6. and that four witnesses at Alts. Clothier's, So, 1, Granville Villas, South-road, Southend, could answer for my being in ted the whole of that time, and now ho says there has not been prodooed sufficient proof.

Junes Csnbun Read, popularly known as the Southend murderer, was executed at Chelmsford on Tuesday. About half-@pa t seven the Under-Sheriff Sir. Gepp drore up with his quaintly-attired marshal on the box of the eoach, and a moment after@ wards the prison bell began to toll at short intervals. The two reporters who were to represent the public entered with the Under-@Sheriff, and ten minutes of suspense were spent in the Governor's room in hushed con@ versation. Billington, who came to Chelms@ ford from London at half-past three on Monday and bad slept at the gaol, came in harriedly for some final instructions, and a moment later the gaol surgeon Dr. E. Hunt Carter was sent for. He was only absent for a minnte or two, and remarked on his return that the convict had asked for a stimulant, and had been given some branny, his chief anxiety, however, being as to the quickness and painlessness of his end. Dr. Carter assured him that he would feel nothing whatever, and Read appeared to be satisfied. Before this breakfast-a plain one, of bread and butter-bad been e.Ven in the presence of the Chaplain, who said that Read was very grateful to him, and soem-d to pay attention to his ministrations@ The culprit had also slept well. Two or three minutes more an-' the Under-Sheriff and the Chaplain - H' e latter in his black gown-went down a few steps to the great central hexagon of the prison. Billington-A @UTILE MAN IN A LIGHT SUIT, and wearing a light travelling cap-was already there,and at two minutes before eight entered the door of the first cell in one of the pass.ges Read appeared to be prepared. He was wearing the light grey clothes which he had on at the trial, ,md on his head was a light cap like that of the executioner. Mr. Gepp asked for the last time if he had anything to say. He replied that be had only to thank the governor and all the officials for their continued kindness ever since he had been in the gaol. His beard was black and bushy. He was wearing a white collar which should have buttoned at tho back of tho neck, but was left open there, and as he passed from the cell into the central hall and thence into the open air he was supported by warders, bat their help seemed needless, f r he walked firmlv and looked resolute, though his face was pale and his pinioned hands twiched convulsively behind him. As the bell struck a further knell the Chaplain began to read the Burial bervice-• I am the resurrection and the life, and the warders outside fell in behind the little procession. It@ was only a step or two to the foot of the gallows - a ponderous cross erected in a little shed. Read, though stoutly built, is really a little man weighing just under nine stone, and a drop of 7ft 8ln was allowed. Quietly enough he took his place ou the trapdoor placing bis feet where Billington directed. Almost before tho last on tho warders had made his way through the narrow doorway all w g over. Across the drop a couple of blaok-palnted planks were laid, and on these the stalwart ward r who held the slight criminal by the left arm took bis stand, but even then the support appeared to he unnecessary for Read held himself as if somebody else rather than he were chiefly concerned, and only muttered to Billington in an undertone, Button my coat. These were HI8 LAST WORDS. The executioner pinioned the convict's feet the arms had been fastened in the cell-snatched off and droped upon the scaffold the cap which Read had been wearing, and adjusted the noose with what sounds like a murmured word of apology. The piece of rubber which keeps the knot in position was at once drawn tight, tf o white cap was ont of Billington s pocket and over Read's head, and then almost before those in the shed knew that the end had come the executioner stepped lightly to the lever and rested upon it for a moment. The trapdoore parted and Read's body diopptd plnmb to swing round in sickening fashion at the end of the rope eight feet below. A twitch or two of the limbs was noticed, but these, the dootor assured those present, were only due to the reflex notion of the muscles, and the neck had bssn broken, deatn consequently being Immediate and painless. Round and round tbc ghastly figure swung as the little party retired@ only a warder or two an 5 Billington being le.t near the corpse while it hung duringtl.e specified hour prior to the inquest, BEAD MADE NO CONFESSION. He died as lie had lived during these latter weeks, protesting his innocence to his family, and declining to say anything at ail to the gaol suthorilies. Subsequently an inquest was held on the body, and the usual formal verdict was returned. Read's last, letter, written a few hours before his death, was as follows -@H.M. Prison, Chelmsford, Dec. 2nd, 1£94 Dear Harry,-In spite of the truth @nd in dehi@nce of the eviflenco presented to him proving my innocence, the Home Secretary has endorsed the murderous conspiracy of his professional brethren.

About half- past seven the Under-Sheriff @Mr. Gepp drove up with his quaintly-attired marshal on the box of the coach, and a moment after- wards the prison bell began to toll at short intervals. The two reporters who were to represent the public entered with the Under- Sheriff, and ten minutes of suspense were spent in the Governor's room in hushed con- versation. Billington, who came to Chelms- ford from London at half-past three on Monday and had slept at the gaol, came in hurriedly for some final instructions, and a moment later the gaol surgeon Dr. E. Hunt Carter was sent for. He was only absent for a minute or two, and remarked on his return that the convict had asked for a stimulant, and had been given some brandy, his chief anxiety, however, being as to the quickness and painlessness of his end. Dr. Carter assured him that he would feel nothing whatever, and Read appeared to be satisfied. Before this breakfast-a plain one, of bread and butter-had been eaten in the presence of the Chaplain, who said that Read was very grateful to him, and seemed to pay attention to his ministrations. The culprit had also slept well. Two or three minutes more an@d the Under-Sheriff and the Chaplain -th@@e latter in his black gown-went down a few steps to the great central hexagon of the prison. Billington-A LITTLE MAN IN A LIGHT SUIT, and wearing a light travelling cap-was already there,and at two minutes before eight entered the door of the first cell in one of the passages Read appeared to be prepared. He was wearing the light grey clothes which he had on at the trial, and on his head was a light cap like that of the executioner. Mr. Gepp asked for the last time if he had anything to say. He replied that he had only to thank the governor and all the officials for their continued kindness ever since he had been in the gaol. His beard was black and bushy. He was wearing a white collar which should have buttoned at the back of the neck, but was left open there, and as he passed form the cell into the central hall and thence into the open air he was supported by warders, but their help seemed needless, for he walked firmly and looked resolute, though his face was pale and his pinioned hands twiched convulsively behind him. As the bell struck a further knell the Chaplain began to read the Burial Service-@ I am the resurrection and the life, and the warders outside fell in behind the little procession. Its was only a step or two to the foot of the gallows -@a ponderous cross erected in a little shed. Read, though stoutly built, is rea@dy a little man weighing just under nine stone, and a drop of 7ft 8in was allowed. Quietly enough he took his place on the trapdoor placing his feet where Billington directed. Almost before the last on the warders had made his way through the narrow doorway all was over. Across the drop a couple of black-painted planks were laid, and on these the stalwart warder who held the slight criminal by the left arm took his stand, but even then the support appeared to be unnecessary for Read held himself as if somebody else rather than he were chiefly concerned, and only muttered to Billington in an undertone, Button my coat. These were HIS LAST WORDS. The executioner pinioned the convict's feet-the arms had been fastened in the cell-snatched off and droped upon the scaffold the cap which Read had been wearing, and adjusted the noose with what sounds like a murmured word of apology. The piece of rubber which keeps the knot in position was at once drawn tight, t@he white cap was out of Billington's pocket and over Read's head, and then almost before those in the shed knew that the end had come the executioner stepped lightly to the lever and rested upon it for a moment. The trapdoors parted and Read's body dropped plumb to swing round in sickening fashion at the end of the rope eight feet below. A twitch or two of the limbs was noticed, but these, the doctor assured those present, were only due to the reflex action of the muscles, and the neck had been broken, death consequently being immediate and painless. Round and round the ghastly figure swung as the little party retired, only a warder or two an@d Billington being left near the corpse while it hung during the specified hour prior to the inquest. READ MADE NO CONFESSION. He died as @he had lived during these latter weeks, protesting his innocence to his family, and declining to say anything at all to the gaol authorities. Subsequently an inquest was held on the body, and the usual formal verdict was returned. Read's last@ letter, written a few hours before his death, was as follows - H.M. Prison, Chelmsford, Dec. 2nd, 1894 Dear Harry,-In spite of the truth and in detiance of the evi@dence presented to him proving my innocence, the Home Secretary has endorsed the murderous conspiracy of his professional brethren. Blood, I pre- sume, is, thicker than water, and 'cliqueism' is stronger than justice. I have written to him this afternoon asking if the inquiries I suggested have bee@n fully made and pointing out that if truthfully answered, then he is acting in defence of evidence. I ####### for an opportunity to procure th@ese proofs which the neglect of my legal representatives kept from judge and jury. My month thus being sealed, I have beforehand referred him @to the medical evidence, which showed that the girl was murdered between twelve midnight 24 6 and 25 6, and that four witnesses at @Mrs. Clothier's@ No. 1, Granville Villas, South-road, Southend, could answer for my being in bed the whole of that time, and now he says there has not been produced sufficient proof. Is not this monstrous? Is it not murder? If this is not proof of my innocence where for God's sake is there proof of ############ Hope to see you to-morrow @@Monday .

READ.@@ Mrs. Clothier, of 1, Gresham-villas, South- church-road, Southend. where Read alleged in his last letter that he slept on the night@ previous to the murder, left Southend about six weeks ago, and the house is now unoccu- pied, but from enquiries made of Armada-villas, Southchur@ch-road,it transpires that her Husband, Mr. Sicely, was interviewed by Detective-Inspector Baker and Super- intendent Hawtree some @days ago, in conse- quence of a statement in Read's petition to t@he Home Secretary. Mr. Sicely upon being shown a photo of Read at once recognised it as to the ma@n who breakfasted with hi@m at Mrs. Clothier's on the Sunday morning before the tragedy at No 1.
