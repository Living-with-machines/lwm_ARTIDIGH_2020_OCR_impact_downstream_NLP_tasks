THE LITERARY EXAMINER. 1 wo Letters on Southern Slavery. Addressed to Thomas Clarkson, Esq. By J. H. Hammond. Columbia, United States. A Planter and Slave-Otvner hailing from a place called Silver Bluff in which we fancy something so expressive of the gentleman th it we can hardly imagine him to be more aptly located, unless indeed it were at Brazen Bluff, which might be better still finds that having abundant leisure it will be a recreation to him to write a couple of letters to Thomas Clarkson. Accordingly, in some spare intervals of Julep, Cocktail, Moral 'Suasion and the like, and with the flavour of these strong drinks rather hot upon him, he goes a-head at a pace which we believe is familiarly compared in his own country to greased lightning and shows that Slavery, as now existing in America, is a sacred, holy, blessed institution expressly founded and commanded by Almighty God, and not to be disputed but by infidels and blasphemers. The gates of Heaven are barred, says the Ordinary to Jonathan Wild, against all revilers of the clergy. They are barred, and double-locked, and bolted, says religious Hammond, against all revilers of Slavery. It will be immediately seen that J. H. Hammond is a pious man. Of his spiritual sprinkling, as Mrs Cole calls it, Slavery has been the precious instrument. American Slavery is to Hammond what precious Mr Squintem was to Mrs Cole. But for it, he might have been tossing in the sea of sin, like a ship, without rudder or compass might have struck against the rocks of reprobation and have been quite swallowed up in the whirlpool of despair. But happily for him, his lot was cast in Carolina so he buys, and sells, and breeds, and flogs, and maims, and does the will of his Father which is in Heaven. Abolition is impossible, says he. There is a God who rules this world-All-Powerful-Far-see ing. He does not permit His creatures to foil His designs. Slavery in all its beautiful forms is His design. Therefore, the Clarksons fail. Therefore, the Hammonds triumph. We accept the Bible terms, says Hammond, as the definition of our Slavery, and its precepts as the guide of our conduct. We desire nothing more. Even the right to 'buffet,' which is esteemed so shocking, finds its express licence in the Gospel.-1 Peter, ii, 20. And is piously and religiously recognised in this part of the Law of North Carolina, which happens to lie ready to our hand. Provided always, this act an act for pretending to make the wilful slaughter of a slave, murder shall not extend to the person killing a slave outlawed by virtue of any act of assembly of this State, or to any slave in the act of resistance to his lawful owner, or to any slave dying under moderate correction !-as adminis tered according to the Gospel of 1 Peter, ii, 20, of course. It appears that the Scriptural directions, on the head of the personal disfiguremeut of slaves, are very precise indeed. For, says Hammond, Goct directs the Hebrews to bore holes in the ears of their brothers to mark them.-Ex. xxi, 6. The ear is therefore, with these new children of Israel, a very favourite place in which to disfigure slaves. Brought to jail, John. Left ear cropt.'' Taken up, a negro man. Is very much scarred about the ear and body, and has the left ear bit off. Ran away, a negro boy, Jack. Has a small crop out of his left ear. Ran away, Joe Dennis. Has a small notch in one of his ears. Ran away, juau, I voiw. Has a small piece cut out of the ■'yf,p ofjfarfh Jf-T rhese are some of the adver-. ti ments emanating from bereaved slaveholders, jj V tjvhick were republished by Mr Dickens-that impure p fountain, as Hammond calls him. It is gratifying to L observe the close adherence to the text, Ex. xxi, G aud to know how diligently these good people act up to the very letter of their Bibles. Who, after this, can challenge this most pious writer, when he adds-I think, then, I may safely conclude, and I firmly be lieve, that American Slavery is. not only not a sin, but espe cially commanded by God through Moses, and approved by Christ through His apostles 1 An Institution, founded and approved on such authority, cannot fail to be a perfect heaven on earth. Our slaves are the happiest three millions of human beings on whom the sun shines. Into their Eden is coming Satan in the guise of an abolitionist. Nor can it fail to be again and again confirmed in Holy Writ, as thus the italics being Ham. mond's own. At the hazard of fatiguing you by repetition, I will again refer you to the ordinances of the Scriptures. Innu merable instances might be quoted where God has given and commanded men to assume dominion over their fellow men. But one will suffice. In the 25th chapter of Levi ticus, you will find Domestic Slavery-precisely suck as is maintained at this day in these States-ordained and esta blished by God, in language which I defy you to pervert so as to leave a doubt on any honest mind that this Institution was founded by Him, and decreed to be perpetual. Or thus In the time of Christ it was usual for masters to put their slaves to death on the slightest provocation. They even killed and cut them up to feed their fishes. He was undoubtedly aware of these things, as well as of the law and commandment I have quoted. He could only have been restrained from denouncing them, as he did the ' lex talionis, because he knew that, in despite of these barba rities, the Institution of Slavery was at the bottom a sound and wholesome as well as lawful one. We have no doubt in our own mind, now, that the miraculous draught of fishes, and the few small fishes that were the subject of the Miracle, had all been fed on slaves and that they were especially selected by the Divine Preacher of the Sermon on the Mount, by reason of their sound and whole some fattening. But Slavery in America is not only surrounded by the halo of religion, it appears it is embellished with a poetry peculiar to itself. Our patriarchal scheme of domestic servitude is indeed well calculated to awaken the higher and finer feelings of our nature. It is not wanting in its enthusiasm and its poetry. The relations of the most beloved and honoured chief, and the most faithful and admiring subjects, which from the time of Homer have been the theme of song, are frigid and unfelt compared with those existing between the master and his slaves-who served his father, and rocked his cradle, or have been born in his house-hold, and look forward to serve his children-who have been through life the props of his fortune, and the objects of his care-who have partaken of his griefs, and looked to him for comfort in their own-whose sickness he has so often watched over and relieved-whose holidays he has so often made joyous by his bounties and his presence for whose welfare when absent his anxious solicitude never ceases, and whose hearty and affectionate greetings never fail to welcome him home. How strange it is how striking an example of the perversity of human nature-of black human nature, at all events that from all this Homeric poetry these happiest human beings on whom the sun shines in its course will run away perpetually! filling the newspapers in the Slave States, so surely as their publication days come round, with adver tisements descriptive of their gashed and rotten persons, at which the wicked stomachs of infidels sicken, and against which the whole soul of man rebels! The God-appointed owners are ' the fathers ' of the slaves ' their shepherds ' everything that is Arcadian, patriarchal, and protective -Hammond says a thousand times. But mark the sudden descent from the Cross the rapid fall from Heaven to Earth the flying off of Mrs Cole, at a tangent, from Squintem to the black-eyed girl of Rosemary lane which is revealed in the following short para graph. The only honest one in fifty pages. Nay, supposing that we were all convinced, and thought of slavery precisely as you do, at what era of 1 moral 'sua sion ' do you imagine you could prevail on us to give up a thousand millions of dollars in the value of our slaves, and a thousand millions of dollars more in the depreciation of our lands, in consequence of the want of labourers to culti vate them ? Consider were ever any people, civilized or savage, persuaded by any argument, Human or Divine, to surrender voluntarily two thousand millions of dollars ? Even Pious Hammond's Piety comes down to dollars. Come ! Buy us oft', says Hammond and we'Jl soon accommodate our Bibles to the bargain. You shall have them, in, if you will only buy us. Yet Hammond thinks that when a base dollar bears a blasphemous presentment of the author of all goodness on its front, it will be taken for celes tial coin, and will have your true angelic ring The Devil is never so simple as when he quotes Scripture for his own ends. Hammond defies public opinion. As for the suggestion, to exclude slaveholders from your London clubs, says he, we scout it. Many of us, indeed, do go to London, and we have seen your breed of gawky Lords both there and here -he seems to have contemplated the breed with a true dealer's eye, by the way - but it never en tered into our conception to look on them as bet ter than ourselves. Nor can we be annoyed by the ridiculous airs of such upstarts as your O'Con nells, Ritchies, Macaulays, and the like. But, oh Godlike-Hammond, we can be annoyed -we can be made very restless and uneasy in our slave-poetry-surrounded beds-by the idea of any foreign nation being so lost to every sentiment of civilized humanity as to attempt to erect amon us the standard of revolt, or to invade us with Black Troops, for the base and barbarous purpose of stirring up servile war. And when that dread ful hour of retribution shall arise-as come it must one day from some dark quarter, if men like you perpetuate this system of atrocious infamy and wrong, this scandal to the truth and justice of mankind-may some scant grain of truth among the monstrous distortions of it which are unblush-ingly put forth to shield the crime of trafficking in human life and liberty some grateful recollection in the breast of an old slave for some old momen tary kindness done preserve the doer from that Red Sea in which the host of charioteers whose cars are dragged by slaves through a false land assuming to be free, shall surely vanish from the earth! Not to-day, O Lord! O not to-day, but in the fulness of their blind resistance to the dictates of Humanity and Right in the noontide of their outrageous prostitution of the names of Liberty and of Religion raise up thine instruments of vengeance from among the lashed and miser able beings crouching at their feet, and strike them down with the accumulated wrath of Gene rations 1 There is no effort that any abolitionist Society in any part of the world could make, that would serve the cause qf abolition half so well as the wide dissemination of such pamphlets as this. They should be reprinted by scores of thousands. Their incredible audacity, and their miserable fee bleness, are means more potent towards the great end than any that ingenuity could devise. Journals of Expeditions of Discovery into Central Australia, and Overland from Adelaide to King George's Sound. By Edward John Eyre, Resi dent Magistrate, Murray River. Two vols. Boone. These expeditions were made in 1840 and '41, but the author's subsequent official employments in South Australia delayed the publication of his book. The greater part of the second volume is devoted to an acc rnnt of the Manners and Cus toms of the Aborigines, and of the state of their relations with Europeans. In undertaking his expeditions into the northern interior of Australia Central Australia, by the way, he cannot be said to have penetrated , Mr Eyre represented the general body of colonists, aud took part in the pecuniary as well as personal risk but received the general sanction of the Government, and some particular aids from them. The hope was that these expeditions might lead to the discovery of a good country, or at any rate open an available route across the Continent. In both points anticipation failed and the actual re sult is as dreary as can be well imagined. Mr Eyre discovered no important rivers, laid open no fertile regions for future colonization. He found nothing but a sterile and desolate wilderness. Through this he toiled for more than twelve months, in the midst of dangers and sufferings which proved fatal to three of his small party. These appear to have been in deed appalling. Their supplies were exhausted they had to kill and eat their horses and but for a lucky accident at last, must surely have perished. His narrative has the interest of a sturdy and gal lant perseverance, unrewarded but by the sense of duty interest of any other kind it has necessarily little. But this is much in itself. Mr Eyre writes with the plain unaffected earnestness of the best of the old travellers. It is not to be omitted, be sides, that several important geographical ob servations were made and that Mr Eyre's failure suggested schemes for success in other direc tions. Naturally, he is not sanguine as to these but he speaks with warm enthusiasm of the effort at present in progress by Captain Sturt, to lift the veil from that still mysterious interior, which he failed himself to raise. It is a year since Captain Sturt set out, and, by communications since received from him, it would appear that he is sanguine of having realized the long hoped-for sea, and of having at last found a key to the centre of the continent. A brief extract will show the general character of Mr Eyre's narrative, and the sufferings far from the most desperate of his party.

Accordingly, in some spare intervals of Julep, Cocktail, Moral 'Suasion and the like, and with the @ﬂavour of these strong drinks rather hot upon him, he goes a‐head at a pace which we believe is familiarly compared in his own country to greased lightning and shows that Slavery, as now existing in America, is a sacred, holy, blessed institution expressly founded and commanded by Almighty God, and not to be disputed but by in@ﬁdels and blasphemers. The gates of Heaven are barred, says the Ordinary to Jonathan Wild, against all revilers of the clergy. They are barred, and double‐locked, and bolted, says religious Hammond, against all revilers of Slavery. It will be immediately seen that J. H. Hammond is a pious man. Of his spiritual sprinkling, as Mrs Cole calls it, Slavery has been the precious instrument. American Slavery is to Hammond what precious Mr Squintem was to Mrs Cole. But for it, he might have been tossing in the sea of sin, like a ship, without rudder or compass might have struck against the rocks of reprobation and have been quite swallowed up in the whirlpool of despair. But happily for him, his lot was cast in Carolina so he buys, and sells, and breeds, and @ﬂogs, and maims, and does the will of his Father which is in Heaven. Abolition is impossible, says he. There is a God who rules this world-All‐Powerful-Far‐see- ing. He does not permit His creatures to foil His designs. Slavery in all its beautiful forms is His design. Therefore, the Clarksons fail. Therefore, the Hammonds triumph. We accept the Bible terms, says Hammond, as the de@ﬁnition of our Slavery, and its precepts as the guide of our conduct. We desire nothing more. Even the right to ' bu@ﬀet,' which is esteemed so shocking, @ﬁnds its express licence in the Gospel.-1 Peter, ii, 20. And is piously and religiously recognised in this part of the Law of North Carolina, which happens to lie ready to our hand. Provided always, this act an act for pretending to make the wilful slaughter of a slave, murder shall not extend to the person killing a slave outlawed by virtue of any act of assembly of this State, or to any slave in the act of resistance to his lawful owner, or to any slave DYING ############################## adminis- tered according to the Gospel of 1 Peter, ii, 20, of course. It appears that the Scriptural directions, on the head of the personal dis@ﬁguremeut of slaves, are very precise indeed. For, says Hammond, Go@d directs the Hebrews to bore holes in the ears of their brothers to mark them.-Ex. xxi, 6. The ear is therefore, with these new children of Israel, a very favourite place in which to dis@ﬁgure slaves. Brought to jail, John. Left ear cropt.@@ Taken up, a negro man.

It is gratifying to @@observe the close adherence to the text, Ex. xxi, 6 and to know how diligently these good people act up to the very letter of their Bibles. Who, after this, can challenge this most pious writer, when he adds- I think, then, I may safely conclude, and I @ﬁrmly be- lieve, that American Slavery is@ not only not a sin, but espe- cially commanded by God through Moses, and approved by Christ through His apostles ! An Institution, founded and approved on such authority, cannot fail to be a perfect heaven on earth. Our slaves are the happiest three millions of human beings on whom the sun shines. Into their Eden is coming Satan in the guise of an abolitionist. Nor can it fail to be again and again con@ﬁrmed in Holy Writ, as thus the italics being Ham- mond's own. At the hazard of fatiguing you by repetition, I will again refer you to the ordinances of the Scriptures. Innu- merable instances might be quoted where God has given and commanded men to assume dominion over their fellow men. But one will su@@ﬃce. In the 25th chapter of Levi- ticus, you will @ﬁnd Domestic Slavery-precisely such as is maintained at this day in these States-ordained and esta- blished by God, in language which I defy you to pervert so as to leave a doubt on any honest mind that this Institution was founded by Him, and decreed to be perpetual. Or thus In the time of Christ it was usual for masters to put their slaves to death on the slightest provocation. They even killed and cut them up to feed their @ﬁshes. He was undoubtedly aware of these things, as well as of the law and commandment I have quoted. He could only have been restrained from denouncing them, as he did the ' lex talionis,' because he knew that, in despite of these barba- rities, the Institution of Slavery was at the bottom a sound and wholesome as well as lawful one. We have no doubt in our own mind, now, that the miraculous draught of @ﬁshes, and the few small @ﬁshes that were the subject of the Miracle, had all been fed on slaves and that they were especially selected by the Divine Preacher of the Sermon on the Mount, by reason of their sound and whole- some fattening. But Slavery in America is not only surrounded by the halo of religion, it appears it is embellished with a poetry peculiar to itself. Our patriarchal scheme of domestic servitude is indeed well calculated to awaken the higher and @ﬁner feelings of our nature. It is not wanting in its enthusiasm and its poetry. The relations of the most beloved and honoured chief, and the most faithful and admiring subjects, which from the time of Homer have been the theme of song, are frigid and unfelt compared with those existing between the master and his slaves-who served his father, and rocked his cradle, or have been born in his house‐hold, and look forward to serve his children-who have been through life the props of his fortune, and the objects of his care-who have partaken of his griefs, and looked to him for comfort in their own-whose sickness he has so often watched over and relieved-whose holidays he has so often made joyous by his bounties and his presence for whose welfare when absent his anxious solicitude never ceases, and whose hearty and a@ﬀectionate greetings never fail to welcome him home. How strange it is how striking an example of the perversity of human nature-of black human nature, at all events that from all this Homeric poetry these happiest human beings on whom the sun shines in its course will run away perpetually ! @ﬁlling the newspapers in the Slave States, so surely as their publication days come round, with adver- tisements descriptive of their gashed and rotten persons, at which the wicked stomachs of in@ﬁdels sicken, and against which the whole soul of man rebels ! The God‐appointed owners are ' the fathers ' of the slaves ' their shepherds ' everything that is Arcadian, patriarchal, and protective -Hammond says a thousand times. But mark the sudden descent from the Cross the rapid fall from Heaven to Earth the @ﬂying o@ﬀ of Mrs Cole, at a tangent, from Squintem to the black‐eyed girl of Rosemary lane which is revealed in the following short para- graph. The only honest one in @ﬁfty pages. Nay, supposing that we were all convinced, and thought of slavery precisely as you do, at what era of ' moral 'sua- sion ' do you imagine you could prevail on us to give up a thousand millions of dollars in the value of our slaves, and a thousand millions of dollars more in the depreciation of our lands, in consequence of the want of labourers to culti- vate them ? Consider were ever any people, civilized or savage, persuaded by any argument, Human or Divine, to surrender voluntarily two thousand millions of dollars ? Even Pious Hammond's Piety comes down to dollars. Come ! Buy us o@@ﬀ, says Hammond and we'll soon accommodate our Bibles to the bargain. You shall have them, in, if you will only buy us. Yet Hammond thinks that when a base dollar bears a blasphemous presentment of the author of all goodness on its front, it will be taken for celes- tial coin, and will have your true angelic ring The Devil is never so simple as when he quotes Scripture for his own ends. Hammond de@ﬁes public opinion. As for the suggestion, to exclude slaveholders from your London clubs, says he, we scout it. Many of us, indeed, do go to London, and we have seen your breed of gawky Lords both there and here - he seems to have contemplated the breed with a true dealer's eye, by the way - but it never en tered into our conception to look on them as bet- ter than ourselves. Nor can we be annoyed by the ridiculous airs of such upstarts as your O'Con- nells, Ritchies, Macaulays, and the like. But, oh Godlike‐Hammond, we can be annoyed -we can be made very restless and uneasy in our slave‐poetry‐surrounded beds-by the idea of any foreign nation being so lost to every sentiment of civilized humanity as to attempt to erect among us the standard of revolt, or to invade us with Black Troops, for the base and barbarous purpose of stirring up servile war. And when that dread- ful hour of retribution shall arise-as come it must, one day from some dark quarter, if men like you perpetuate this system of atrocious infamy and wrong, this scandal to the truth and justice of mankind-may some scant grain of truth among the monstrous distortions of it which are unblush- ingly put forth to shield the crime of tra@@ﬃcking in human life and liberty some grateful recollection in the breast of an old slave for some old momen- tary kindness done preserve the doer from that Red Sea in which the host of charioteers whose cars are dragged by slaves through a false land assuming to be free, shall surely vanish from the earth ! Not to‐day, O Lord ! O not to‐day, but in the fulness of their blind resistance to the dictates of Humanity and Right in the noontide of their outrageous prostitution of the names of Liberty and of Religion raise up thine instruments of vengeance from among the lashed and miser- able beings crouching at their feet, and strike them down with the accumulated wrath of Gene- rations ! There is no e@ﬀort that any abolitionist Society in any part of the world could make, that would serve the cause of abolition half so well as the wide dissemination of such pamphlets as this. They should be reprinted by scores of thousands. Their incredible audacity, and their miserable fee- bleness, are means more potent towards the great end than any that ingenuity could devise. Journals of Expeditions of Discovery into Central Australia, and Overland from Adelaide to King George's Sound. By Edward John Eyre, Resi- dent Magistrate, Murray River. Two vols. Boone. These expeditions were made in 1840 and '41, but the author's subsequent o@@ﬃcial employments in South Australia delayed the publication of his book. The greater part of the second volume is devoted to an acc@ount of the Manners and Cus- toms of the Aborigines, and of the state of their relations with Europeans. In undertaking his expeditions into the northern interior of Australia Central Australia, by the way, he cannot be said to have penetrated , Mr Eyre represented the general body of colonists, and took part in the pecuniary as well as personal risk but received the general sanction of the Government, and some particular aids from them. The hope was that these expeditions might lead to the discovery of a good country, or at any rate open an available route across the Continent. In both points anticipation failed and the actual re- sult is as dreary as can be well imagined. Mr Eyre discovered no important rivers, laid open no fertile regions for future colonization. He found nothing but a sterile and desolate wilderness. Through this he toiled for more than twelve months, in the midst of dangers and su@ﬀerings which proved fatal to three of his small party. These appear to have been in- deed appalling. Their supplies were exhausted they had to kill and eat their horses and but for a lucky accident at last, must surely have perished. His narrative has the interest of a sturdy and gal- lant perseverance, unrewarded but by the sense of duty interest of any other kind it has necessarily little. But this is much in itself. Mr Eyre writes with the plain una@ﬀected earnestness of the best of the old travellers. It is not to be omitted, be- sides, that several important geographical ob- servations were made and that Mr Eyre's failure suggested schemes for success in other direc- tions. Naturally, he is not sanguine as to these but he speaks with warm enthusiasm of the e@ﬀort at present in progress by Captain Sturt, to lift the veil from that still mysterious interior, which he failed himself to raise. It is a year since Captain Sturt set out, and, by communications since received from him, it would appear that he is sanguine of having realized the long hoped‐for sea, and of having at last found a key to the centre of the continent. A brief extract will show the general character of Mr Eyre's narrative, and the su@ﬀerings far from the most desperate of his party. March 9.-Moving on early we passed through a simi- lar country to that we had before traversed but there was more of the tea‐tree scrub, which made our travelling more di@@ﬃcult and fatiguing. This kind of scrub, which is dif- ferent from any I had seen before, is a low bush running along the ground, with very thick and crooked roots and branches, and forming a close matted and harassing obstacle to the traveller. The sheep and horses got very tired, from having to lift their legs so high to clear it every step they took. To the westward we found the country rising as we advanced, and the cli@ﬀs becoming higher..... After travelling twenty@‐ﬁve miles we halted for an hour or two to rest the sheep and horses, feeding was out of the ques- tion, for they were too much in want of water to attempt #############################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################
