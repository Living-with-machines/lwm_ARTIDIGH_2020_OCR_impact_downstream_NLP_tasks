Ihis getting iuto debt is a bat'scheme. Yon ought to pay as you go. I'd like to but I'm always going broke, The Editor's Table. Absent Ybt Present, by Gilbert M. T Lyon, 3 vols., London Digby, Long, and Co. We were able to speak in very high praise of Misa Lyon's former story, For Good or Evil. This, however,is far better and mnst be elasaed amongst the best books of ths season. The writer has conspicuous talents in her de scription of the scenery whither she guides ns in the portraiture of the characters with which she peoples her story, in the varied pleasantries and troublous periods which go to make up the delightful romance which she unfolds in her pages, we are enchained by the most sympathetic ties, until the fortunes of hero and heroine are spun out to their satisfactory issues. It would be a misfortune to those who might accept our verdict and ask at the library for this fasoiuating book, were wo to reveal i,he plot, but it will add to the anticipations of local readers if we state that a large portion of the locale is at or near Teignmoutb, the little town coming in for a quaintly interesting description. From firvt to last the book is continuously pleasing and bright tilers is not a dull page. The only disappointment is that a careless printer's reader has overlooked several stupid blunders.

FtJB AND LACE TOQUE. FIG. 1. Turbans aie to be worn for evening dress this winter an annouuccment producing aws and trembling, till we find they will bear no resemblance to the fearful and wonderful erections worn by ladies some sixty or seventy year back, which, in addition to a mighty swathing of gauze, silk, and muslin, were decorated with anything in the way of gorgeous jewels or feathers up to a bird of paradise. The up-to-date turban will be quite small, and really like the veiy pretty Cloohss de Corneville caps, worn also for evening about ten years ago. In Fig. 2 we have a very becoming blouse, In deep red bengaline, trimmed with jet passementerie. This pretty bodice is tucked over the shoulders, from whence it ia allowed to go free over the bust, then tucked again at the waist, and loose once more below. The tabs of jetting passing between each row of tucks terminate in jet fringe, which also finishes the same at threat and wrists. The sleeves, it will be seen, are of Bishop pattern, with rows of jet passementerie placed perpen dicularly. Sold by specially appointed Distributive Agents throughout the Kingdom.

Mr.Justice Williams made an order on Thurs day for the compulsory winding up of the Bank of South Australia.

When MATCHLESS CLEANSER SOAP is used MATCHLESS CLEANSER has swept away A thousand worries of Washing Day, At Liverpool on Wednesday a man who gave the name of John Smith, alias W. Webb, belonging to London, was remanded on a charge of breaking into eleven churches in the city and suburbs and stealing various articles, including contents of money boxes. William Thomas Patterson was also remanded at Liverpool on a charge of threatening to hoot a policeman. Prisoner was caught loitering near the judge's residence with afull-loaded revolver about the time the justices were passing for assizes. A STYLISH BLOUSE. FIG. 2 This design would look equally well in any material pliant enough to allow of the tuck ing. Velvet blouses are charming for winter wear, but would not make up welliu a tucked design of this kind, as it would make the waist so thick. Crepou is undoubtedly the material just now of fancy kinds. In addition to the Wave Mohair ' we have previously chroni cled, two fnrther introductions are now being used for winter gowns, the Oaracuille end the Bark crepons. The latter is, as its name suggests, an imitation of the bark of a tree the undulations being about the same size as those of a medium size tree bark. Such pronounced patterned fabrics as i h so should be most sparingly trimmed, and ot the various trimmings bow ait fait velvet is the best of any. Sentence of Death. Sarah Ann Albery, 34, sinade woman, was sentenced to death at Nottingham Assizes on Thursday for murdering her child, sovebzeeu months. Prisoner on the day preceding the crime had been taxed by her mother as to her condition. She left home and walked into tte river Trent. The baby was drowned, but prisoner was rescuscitated. The jury made a strong recommendation to mercy. It was proposed to empanel a jury of matrons, but the Judge held that It was unnecessary, pro mising that effect should be given to the recommendation of the jury. Arrest of a Supposed Housebreaker at Barnstaple. On Wednesday at the Barnstaple Borough Police Court-before Messrs. S. Goss, W. Curtis, and W.

The Surveyor Mr. Churchward reported thai, at a meeting of the Gas Committee to con sider whether any alteration should be made 1 1 Jhe t'me for extinguishing..,the public rSmp the matter was deferred for the con sideration of the new Board.-Mr. Stocker said the committee thought the extended time was necessary, but had deferred it so that it might not be said that it bad been done for electioneering purposes. - Mr. Churchward further reported that there was one patient in the Saattorinm. As directed at the last meeting, he had prepared plans and estimate for an outfall sewer from the present works to the river Exe at Duck's Marsh and Countess Weir. With reference to the latter scheme, the length of the sewer was 3,572 yards with an inclination of one in 900. The cost of this scheme would be£5,000. in the Duck's Marsh scheme the length of ths sewer was 2,337 yards with an inclination of one in 900. The cost of this scheme would be £3,550. Sir Redvers Bullcr was proceeding very slowly in the connection of his drains to the main sewer on the other sido of the mill leat -It was decided to submit the two sewage schemes as alternatives when the Local Government Board enquiry takes place.-On the motion of Mr. Tucker, seconded by Mr Densham, it was decided that Sir Redvers Buller be summoned. The Last Act Vote3 of Thanks. Mr. Heath, in moving a vote of thanks to tho Chairman for his conduct in the chair, said the manner in which he had conducted the Board's business reflected the greatest credit on him. Sinco he the speaker ' had been on the Board-about twenty-seven years-a lot of business had been done, and the manner in which it had boon carried out had prevented them spending a single £5 note in needless expen diture.-Mr. Stocker seconded. In all his public life nothing had given him greater pleasure than the way in whioh tbe r business had besn conducted If what had been called tho young gang would take a losson from the old gang it would be all as it ought to be. After fifty years the Board would, in a few days, tease to exist, and he thought no Board in the land could show better results than they. Their experience bad been unique, for during all those years there had only been three chairmen-Mr. WentworthBuller, Mr. Robert Taylor Pinn , and, for the last twenty-five years, Mr. Farrant-and during twenty-five years they hail only had two clerk . He believed it was thirty years ago that verv day that Mr. Champion was appointed Anything in praise of him would boeuperflaoua The Surveyor was a very good man, and he had good men under him.-The motior was carried unanimously.-Mr. B'arrant thanked the members most heartily for the kind mauufer in which they had spoken of bin,and for their kindness to him during the time he had presided Over them. Ho heartily concurred in Mr.Stocker's remarks regarding the officers. Mr. Chitmpion had shown himself a master of finance and the extension of their water works, the magnificent flitcr-beds, second to none in England, jvere a credit to Mr. Choroh-ward, to the parish, and to the Board. It was with the grealeit possible regret that he saw that several of his old trieods had not again cams forward. F. C. Bond,licensed victualler of Plymouth, has been adjudicated a bankrupt.

T Lyon, 3 vols., London Digby, Long, and Co. We were able to speak in very high praise of Misa Lyon's former story, For Good or Evil. This, however,@is far better and mnst be elasaed amongst the best books of ths season. The writer has conspicuous talents in her de@ scription of the scenery whither she guides ns in the portraiture of the characters with which she peoples her story, in the varied pleasantries and troublous periods which go to make up the delightful romance which she unfolds in her pages, we are enchained by the most sympathetic ties, until the fortunes of hero and heroine are spun out to their satisfactory issues. It would be a misfortune to those who might accept our verdict and ask at the library for this fasoiuating book, were wo to reveal i,he plot, but it will add to the anticipations of local readers if we state that a large portion of the locale is at or near Teignmoutb, the little town coming in for a quaintly interesting description. From firvt to last the book is continuously pleasing and bright tilers is not a dull page. The only disappointment is that a careless printer's reader has overlooked several stupid blunders.

FIG. 2 This design would look equally well in any material pliant enough to allow of the tuck@ ing. Velvet blouses are charming for winter wear, but would not make up well@iu a tucked design of this kind, as it would make the waist so thick. Crepou is undoubtedly the material just now of fancy kinds. In addition to the Wave Mohair ' we have previously chroni@ cled, two fnrther introductions are now being used for winter gowns, the Oaracuille end the Bark crepons. The latter is, as its name suggests, an imitation of the bark of a tree the undulations being about the same size as those of a medium size tree bark. Such pronounced patterned fabrics as i h so should be most sparingly trimmed, and ot the various trimmings bow ait fait velvet is the best of any. Sentence of Death.

As directed at the last meeting, he had prepared plans and estimate for an outfall sewer from the present works to the river Exe at Duck's Marsh and Countess Weir. With reference to the latter scheme, the length of the sewer was 3,572 yards with an inclination of one in 900.

Mr. Heath, in moving a vote of thanks to tho Chairman for his conduct in the chair, said the manner in which he had conducted the Board's business reflected the greatest credit on him. Sinco he the speaker ' had been on the Board-about twenty-seven years-a lot of business had been done, and the manner in which it had boon carried out had prevented them spending a single £5 note in needless expen@ diture.-Mr. Stocker seconded. In all his public life nothing had given him greater pleasure than the way in whioh tbe r business had besn conducted If what had been called tho young gang would take a losson from the old gang it would be all as it ought to be. After fifty years the Board would, in a few days, tease to exist, and he thought no Board in the land could show better results than they.

FIG. 2 This design would look equally well in any material pliant enough to allow of the tuck- ing. Velvet blouses are charming for winter wear, but would not make up well in a tucked design of this kind, as it would make the waist so thick. Crepon is undoubtedly the material just now of fancy kinds. In addition to the Wave Mohair@@ we have previously chroni- cled, two further introductions are now being used for winter gowns, the Caracuille and the Bark crepons. The latter is, as its name suggests, an imitation of the bark of a tree the undulations being about the same size as those of a medium size tree bark.

The Surveyor Mr. Churchward reported tha@t at a meeting of the Gas Committee to con- sider whether any alteration should be made @in the time for extinguishing@@ the public lamp the matter was deferred for the con- sideration of the new Board.-Mr. Stocker said the committee thought the extended time was necessary, but had deferred it so that it might not be said that it had been done for electioneering purposes.@-@Mr. Churchward further reported that there was one patient in the Sanitorium. As directed at the last meeting, he had prepared plans and estimate for an outfall sewer from the present works to the river Exe at Duck's Marsh and Countess Weir. With reference to the latter scheme. the length of the sewer was 3,572 yards with an inclination of one in 900. The cost of this scheme would be £5,000. In the Duck's Marsh scheme the length of the sewer was 2,337 yards with an inclination of one in 900. The cost of this scheme would be £3,550. Sir Redvers Buller was proceeding very slowly in the connection of his drains to the main sewer on the other side of the mill leat -It was decided to submit the two sewage schemes as alternatives when the Local Government Board enquiry takes places.-On the motion of Mr. Tucker, seconded by Mr. Densham, it was decided that Sir Redvers Buller be summoned. The Last Act Votes of Thanks. Mr. Heath, in moving a vote of thanks to the Chairman for his conduct in the chair, said the manner in which he had conducted the Board's business reflected the greatest credit on him. Since he the speaker @@had been on the Board-about twenty-seven years-a lot of business had been done, and the manner in which it had been carried out had prevented them spending a single £5 note in needless expen- diture.-Mr. Stocker seconded. In all his public life nothing had given him greater pleasure than the way in which their business had been conducted If what had been called the young gang would take a losson from the old gang it would be all as it ought to be. After fifty years the Board would, in a few days, cease to exist, and he thought no Board in the land could show better results than they. Their experience had been unique, for during all those years there had only been three chairmen-Mr. Wentworth Buller, Mr. Robert Taylor Pines, and, for the last twenty-five years, Mr. Farrant-and during twenty-five years they ha@d only had two clerks. He believed it was thirty years ago that very day that Mr. Champion was appointed. Anything in praise of him would be superfluous. The Surveyor was a very good man, and he had good men under him.-The motion was carried unanimously.-Mr. @Farrant thanked the members most heartily for the kind ma@nner in which they had spoken of him, and for their kindness to him during the time he had presided over them. He heartily concurred in Mr. Stocker's remarks regarding the officers. Mr. Ch@ampion had shown himself a master of finance and the extension of their water- works, the magnificent fliter-beds, second to none in England, @were a credit to Mr. Church- ward, to the parish, and to the Board. It was with the greatest possible regret that he saw that several of his old friends had not again came forward. F. C.
