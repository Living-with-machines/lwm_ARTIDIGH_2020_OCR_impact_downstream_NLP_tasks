[OCR_toInput] BK. II. 196 AN ENGLISH ANTHOLOGY. CLXV. IN PRAISE OF HOPE. Hope, of all ills that men endure The only cheap and universal cure ! Thou captive's freedom, and thou sick man's health ! Thou loser's victory, and thou beggar's wealth ! Thou manna, which from Heaven we eat, To even- taste a several meat Thou strong retreat, thou sure entailed estate, Which nought has power to alienate ! Thou pleasant, honest flatterer, for none Flatter unhappy men, but thou alone ! Hope, thou first-fruits of happiness ! Thou gentle dawning of a bright success ! Thou good preparative, without which our joy Does work too strong, and, whilst it cures, destroy Who out of Fortune's reach dost stand, And art a blessing still in hand ! Whilst thee, her earnest-money, we retain We certain are to gain, Whether she her bargain break, or else fulfil Thou only good, not worse for ending ill ! Brother of Faith, 'twixt whom and thee The joys of Heaven and earth divided be ! Though Faith be heir, and have the fixed estate, Thy portion yet in moveables is great. Happiness itself's all one In thee, or in possession ! Referring to this and its companion piece, Against Hope, John son says ' What Cowley has written upon Hope shows an unequalled fertility of invention '.
