[OCR_toInput] 328 BK. Ill AN ENGLISH ANTHOLOGY. II. I. ' Weave the warp, and weave the woof, The winding-sheet of Edward's race. Give ample room, and verge enough The characters of hell to trace. Mark the year, and mark the night, When Severn shall re-echo with affright The shrieks of death, thro' Berkley's roofs that ring. Shrieks of an agonizing King ! She-wolf of France, with unrelenting fangs, That tear'st the bowels of thy mangled mate, From thee be born, who o'er thy country hangs The scourge of Heaven. What terrors round him wait ! Amazement in his van, with Flight combined. And Sorrow's faded form, and Solitude behind. II. 2. ' Might - Victor, mighty Lord ! Low on his funeral couch he lies ! No pitying heart, no eye, afford A tear to grace his obsequies. Is the sable Warrior fled ? Thy son is gone. He rests among the dead. The swarm, that in thy noontide beam were born ? Gone to salute the rising Morn. Fair laughs the Morn, and soft the Zephyr blows, While proudly riding o'er the azure realm In gallant trim the gilded vessel goes Youth on the prow, and Pleasure at the helm Regardless of the sweeping Whirlwind's sway, That, hushed in grim repose, expects his evening-prey. 51. 'I have a soul that like an ample shield Can take in all, and verge enough for more '. - Dryden, Don Sebastian. 55. Edward II. was murdered in Berkley Castle. 57. She-wolf of France. Isabel of France, wife of Edward II. and mother of Edward III.
