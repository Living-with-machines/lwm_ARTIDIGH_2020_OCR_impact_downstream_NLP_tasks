[OCR_toInput] BK. III. AN ENGLISH ANTHOLOGY. 294 SECTION III. 1746-1757 . CCXXXIII. ODE WRITTEN IN THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR 1746. How sleep the brave who sink to rest, By all their country's wishes blest ! When Spring with dewy fingers cold, Returns to deck their hallowed mould, She there shall dress a sweeter sod Than Fancy's feet have ever trod. By fairy hands their knell is rung. By forms unseen their dirge is sung There Honour comes, a pilgrim grey. To bless the turf that wraps their clay, And Freedom shall awhile repair, To dwell a weeping hermit there ! -Collins. ccxxxiv. FROM THE CASTLE OF INDOLENCE. O mortal man, who livest here bv toil. Do not complain of this thy hard estate That like an emmet thou must ever moil, Is a sad sentence of an ancient date And, certes, there is for it reason great For though sometimes it makes thee weep and wail, And curse thy star, and early drudge and late, Withouten that would come a heavier bale. Loose life, unruly passions, and diseases pale. In imitation of The Faery Quecne. These are the first six stanzas. There are seventy-seven stanzas in canto i. and seventy-nine in canto ii.
