[OCR_toInput] LAN-GO-LEE. ■ 0 M, e border of famous Cork city, JtX To fair London town it was my intent, 1 stepp'd up to Cove, where I met with a captain, Who told me to Bristol he fully was bent. I soon got on deck where I saw the wide ocean, I espied a large ship and she lying in full motion, To turn back to Cork, sir, I had a great notion, To sit with my friends and sing Lan-go-lee. Said I to the captain, consider the danger That now may attend us in crossing the main, And I to the roaring of seas hke a stranger, Perhaps never more to return again. The only request I beg of you now, sir, If you got another ship, pray bring the two, sir, If one should be lost that the other might do sir, And then we'll go safe, singing Lan-go-lee. The cajitain replied, my hearty good fellow, To think of another ship that could not be, For all the best treasure that ever you mastered, That would not be plenty to satisfy me. I cried, blood an ouns, what makes you unwilling ? If money you want here's another five shillings, So bring both your ships and be shure of the rigging, And then we'll go safe, singing Lan-go-lee. Our ship she set sail with a most pleasant gale, Till she turnerl about then the deep I could see, It was then my poor heart it began for to wreck, When I thought of the joys of my own country. At length Lundy Island appeareel in my sight, sir, Anel with a loud voice I most eagerly cried, sir, Saying, here is Black-rock draw your ship along-side, sir, And then you'll be safe singing Lan-go-lee. The storm arose and our ship she was tossed Just like a football when kicked in a crowd The captain replied, we shall all be lost, For each man's assistance he then cried aloud I under the deck hke a mouse foi'4o creep, sir, Expecting each moment to fall in the deep, sir, I on me knees most bitterly weep'd, sir, Faith ! I'd no great mind to sing Lan-go-lee. When I returned the steamer was over, Our ship she not seemingly stirr'd but stood still, I stepp'd upon deck where I soon did recover, And safelv we landed in a place they call'd Pill. I packed up the remainder of all my sea store, sir, And in a small ship they put me on shore, sir, Going into a kingdom I ne'er was before, sir,, dTj I stirr'd up my heart and sung Lan-go-le,e.o ' I hurried myself to a public-house, 2k-Where I called for a gallon of the best beer~ §1 To crown me with liquor and more resolution, The landlady cried, my good fellow, don't fear. You may drink a plenty of porter and gin, sir, Your Irish beliaviour my favour cloth win, sir, For fear that my husband may chance to come in sir, Be quick with the toast of your Lan-go-lee.

Now, Rory, be aisy, sweet Kathleen would cry, Reproof on her lip, but a smile in her eye, With your tricks I don't know, in troth, what I'm about, out Faith, youv'e teazed till I've put on my cloak inside Oh ! jewel, says Rory, that same is the way You've thrated my heart for this many a day, And 'tis plased that I am, and why not, to be sure ? For 'tis all for good luck, says bold Rory O'More. Indeed, then, says Kathleen, don't think of the like, For I half gave a promise to smothering Mike, The ground that I walk on he loves, I'll be bound, Faith, says Rory, I'd rather love you than the ground. Now, Rorv, I'll cry, if you don't let me go, Sure I dream every night that I am hating you so ! Oh, says Rory, that same I'm delighted to hear, For drames always go by contraries, my dear Oh, jewel, keep draming that same till you die, And bright morning will give dirty night the black he, And 'tis pleased that I am, and why not, to be sure ? Since 'tis all for good luck, says bold Rory O'More. Arrah, Kathleen, my darlint, you've teazed me enough, And I've thrashed for your sake Dinny Grimes and Jim Duff, And I've made myself, drinking your health, quite a baste, So I think after that I may talk to the praist. Then Rory, the rogue, stole his arm round her neck, So soft and so white, without freckle or speck, And he looked in her eyes that were beaming with light And he kissed her sweet lips - don't you think he wax-right ? Now, Roiy, leave off, sir, - you hug me no more, That's eight times to-day that you've kiss'd me before, Then there goes for another, says he, to make sure, For there's luck in odd numbers, says Rory O'More. ® I ISTO. 671.
