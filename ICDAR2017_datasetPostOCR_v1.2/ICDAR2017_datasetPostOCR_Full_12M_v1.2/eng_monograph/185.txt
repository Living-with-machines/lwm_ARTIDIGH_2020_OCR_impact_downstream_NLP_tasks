ADAM AND EVE. Two of far nobler shape, erect and tall, Godlike erect, with native honour clad, In naked majesty, seemed lords of all And worthy seemed for in their looks divine The image of their glorious Maker shone Truth, wisdom, sanctitude severe and pure, Severe, but in true filial freedom placed, Whence true authority in men though both Not equal, as their sex not equal seemed For contemplation he and valour formed, For softness she, and sweet attractive grace He for God only, she for God in him. His fair large front and eye sublime declared Absolute rule and hyacinthine locks Round from his parted forelock manly hung Clustering, but not beneath his shoulders broad She as a veil, down to the slender waist, Her unadorned golden tresses wore Dishevelled, but in wanton ringlets waved. As the vine curls her tendrils, which implied Subjection, but required with gentle sway, And by her yielded, by him best received, Yielded with coy submission, modest pride, And sweet, reluctant, amorous delay. - Paradise Lost, iv. 288-311
