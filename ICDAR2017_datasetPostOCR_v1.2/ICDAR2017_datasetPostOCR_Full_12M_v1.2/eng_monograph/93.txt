This royal throne of kings, this sceptred isle, This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars, This other Eden, demi-paradise, This fortress, built by Nature for herself Against infection and the hand of war, This happy breed of men, this little world, This precious stone set in the silver sea, Which serves it in the office of a wall, Or as a moat defensive to a house, Against the envy of less happier lands, This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England, This nurse, this teeming womb of royal kings, Feared by their breed, and famous by their birth, Renowned for their deeds as far from home, For Christian service, and true chivalry As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry Of the world's ransom, blessed Man's son This land of such dear souls, this dear, dear land, Dear for her reputation through the world, Is now leased out I die pronouncing it , Like to a tenement, or pelting farm England, bound in with the triumphant sea, Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege Of watery Neptune, is now bound in with shame, With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds That England, that was wont to conquer others, Hath made a shameful conquest of itself Ah, would the scandal vanish with my life, How happy then were my ensuing death ! 1594. - Richard II., ii. 1
