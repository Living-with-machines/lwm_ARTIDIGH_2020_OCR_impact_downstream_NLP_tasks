[OCR_toInput] BK. Ill 244 AN ENGLISH ANTHOLOGY. CCII. APOSTROPHE TO LIBERTY. O Liberty, thou goddess heavenly bright, Profuse of bliss, and pregnant with delight ! Eternal pleasures in thy presence reign, And smiling Plenty leads thy wanton train Eased of her load, Subjection grows more light, And Poverty looks cheerful in thy sight Thou mak'st the gloomy face of Nature gay, Giv'st beauty to the sun and pleasure to the day. Thee, goddess, thee Britannia's isle adores How has she oft exhausted all her stores, How oft in fields of death thy presence sought, Nor thinks the mighty prize too dearly bought ! On foreign mountains may the sun refine The grape's soft juice and mellow it to wine With citron groves adorn a distant soil, And the fat olive swell with floods of oil We envy not the warmer clime that lies In ten degrees of more indulgent skies Nor at the coarseness of our heaven repine, Though o'er our heads the frozen Pleiads shine sis Liberty that crowns Britannia's isle, And makes her barren rocks and her bleak moun tains smile. Others with towering piles may please the sight, And in their proud aspiring domes delight And nicer touch to the stretched canvas give, Or teach their animated rocks to live 'Tis Britain's care to watch o'er Europe's fate And hold in balance each contending state, To threaten bold presumptuous kings with war,
