That which concerns us therefore is to see What species of enthusiasts we be On what materials the fiery source Of thinking life shall execute its force Whether a man shall stir up love, or hate, From the mixed medium of this present state Shall choose with upright heart and mind to rise, And reconnoitre Heaven's primeval skies Or down to lust and rapine to descend, Brute fora time, and demon at its end. Neither perhaps, the wary sceptics cry, And wait till Nature's river shall run dry With sage reserve not passing o'er to good, Of time, lost time, are borne along the flood Content to think such thoughtless thinking right, And common sense enthusiastic flight. . . .
