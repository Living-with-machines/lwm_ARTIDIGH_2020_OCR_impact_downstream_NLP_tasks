[OCR_toInput] SECT. II. 285 FROM THE SCHOOL-MISTRESS. There dwells in lowly shed, and mean attire, A matron old, whom we School-mistress name Who boasts unruly brats with birch to tame They grieven sore, in piteous durance pent, Awed by the power of this relentless dame And oft-times, on vagaries idly bent, For unkempt hair, or task unconned, are sorely shent. And all in sight doth rise a birchen tree, Which Learning near her little dome did stow Whilom a twig of small regard to see, Though now so wide its waving branches flow, And work the simple vassals mickle woe For not a wind might curl the leaves that blew, But their limbs shuddered, and their pulse beat low. And as they looked they found their horror grew, And shaped it into rods, and tingled at the view. So have I seen who has not may conceive A lifeless phantom near a garden placed So doth it wanton birds of peace bereave, Of sport, of song, of pleasure, of repast They start, they stare, they wheel, they look aghast Sad servitude ! such comfortless annoy May no bold Briton's riper age e'er taste ! Ne superstition clog his dance of joy, Ne vision empty, vain, his native bliss destroy. Near to this dome is found a patch so green, On which the tribe their gambols do display And at the door imprisoning board is seen, Lest weakly wights of smaller size should stray Eager, perdie, to bask in sunny day. The noises intermixed, which thence resound, Do Learning's little tenement betray
