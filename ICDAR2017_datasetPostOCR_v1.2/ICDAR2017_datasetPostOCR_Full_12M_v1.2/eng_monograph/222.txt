Grongar, in whose mossy cells, Sweetly-musing Quiet dwells Grongar, in whose silent shade, For the modest Muses made So oft I have, the evening still, At the fountain of a rill, Sat upon a flowery bed, With my hand beneath my head While strayed my eyes o'er Towy's flood, Over mead, and over wood, From house to house, from hill to hill, Till Contemplation had her fill. About his checkered sides I wind, And leave his brooks and meads behind. And groves, and grottos where I lay. And vistas shooting beams of day Wide and wider spreads the vale, As circles on a smooth canal The mountains round, unhappy fate, Sooner or later, of all height, Withdraw their summits from the skies, And lessen as the others rise Still the prospect wider spreads, Adds a thousand woods and meads Still it widens, widens still, And sinks the newly risen hill. Now I gain the mountain's brow, What a landscape lies below! No clouds, no vapours intervene, But the gay, the open scene Does the face of nature show, In all the hues of heaven's bow And, swelling to embrace the light, Spreads around beneath the sight.
