[OCR_toInput] SECT. I. ODE ON THE NATIVITY. 129 See how from far upon the eastern road The star-led wizards haste with odours sweet Oh ! run, prevent them with thy humble ode, And lay it lowly at His blessed feet Have thou the honour first thy Lord to greet, And join thy voice unto the angel quire, From out His secret altar touched with hallowed fire. THE HYMN. It was the winter wild, While the Heaven-born Child All meanly wrapt in the rude manger lies, Nature in awe to Him Had doffed her gaudy trim, With her great Master so to sympathize It was no season then for her To wanton with the sun, her lusty paramour Only with speeches fair, She wooes the gentle air To hide her guilty front with innocent snow. And on her naked shame, Pollute with sinful blame, The saintly veil of maiden white to throw Confounded, that her Maker's eyes Should look so near upon her foul deformities. But He, her fears to cease, Sent down the meek-eyed Peace She, crowned with olive green, came softly sliding Down through the turning sphere, His ready harbinger, With turtle wing the amorous clouds dividing, And, waving wide her myrtle wand, She strikes a universal peace through sea and land. 9
