Whom universal Nature did lament, When, by the rout that made the hideous roar, His gory visage down the stream was sent, Down the swift Hebrus to the Lesbian shore ? Alas ! what boots it with incessant care To tend the homely, slighted, shepherd's trade, And strictly meditate the thankless Muse ? Were it not better done, as others use, To sport with Amaryllis in the shade, Or with the tangles of Neaera's hair ? Fame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise, That last infirmity of noble mind To scorn delights, and live laborious days But the fair guerdon when we hope to find, And think to burst out into sudden blaze, Comes the blind Fury with the abhorred shears And slits the thin-spun life. ' But not the praise, Phoebus replied, and touched my trembling ears ' Fame is no plant that grows on mortal soil, Nor in the glistering foil Set off to the world, nor in broad rumour lies But lives and spreads aloft by those pure eyes And perfect witness of all-judging Jove As he pronounces lastly on each deed, Of so much fame in heaven expect thy meed.' 0 fountain Arethuse, and thou honoured flood Smooth-sliding Mincius, crowned with vocal reeds! That strain I heard was of a higher mood But now my oat proceeds, And listens to the herald of the sea That came in Neptune's plea He asked the waves, and asked the felon winds. What hard mishap hath doomed this gentle swain ? And questioned every gust of rugged wings.
