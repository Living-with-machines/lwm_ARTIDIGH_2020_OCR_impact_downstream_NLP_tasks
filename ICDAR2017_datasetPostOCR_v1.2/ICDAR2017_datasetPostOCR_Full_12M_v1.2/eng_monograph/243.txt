[OCR_toInput] .II. SECT THE STREAM OF LIFE. 293 , V CCXXXII. THE STREAM OF LIFE. Is it, that life hath sown her joys so thick We can't thrust in a single care between ? Is it, that life has such a swarm of cares The thought of death can't enter for the throng ? Is it, that time steals on with downy feet, Nor wakes indulgence from her golden dream ? To-day is so like yesterday, it cheats We take the lying sister for the same. Life glides away, Lorenzo, like a brook For ever changing, unperceived the change. In the same brook none ever bathed him twice, To the same life none ever twice awoke. We call the brook the same the same we think Our life, though still more rapid in its flow Nor mark the much, irrevocably lapsed And mingled with the sea. Or shall we say Retaining still the brook to bear us on That life is like a vessel on the stream ? In life embarked we smoothly down the tide Of time descend, but not on time intent, Amused, unconscious of the gliding wave Till on a sudden we perceive a shock We start, awake, look out what see we there ? Our brittle bark is burst on Charon's shore. - Young's Night Thoughts
