[OCR_toInput] Bnrke's FAREWELL-SHAMROCK SHORE. ■ i HCIee-fN a musing mind with me combine, And grant me great relief, Whilst here alone I sigh and moan, I'm overwhelmed with grief Whilst here alone I sigh and moan, Away from friends at home, With troubled mind no rest can find, Since I left the Shamrock shore. In the blooming spring, when small birds sing, And the lambs did sport and play, My way I took, and friends forsook, Till I came to Dublin Quay I entered on board as a passenger, To England I sailed o'er, I bid farewell to all my friends All around the Shamrock shore. When young men all, both great and small, Go to the fields to walk, Whilst here alone I sigh and moan, To none of them can talk Whilst I remain but to bewail, For the maid that I adore, With a troubled mind, no rest can find, Since I left the Shamrock shore. To Glasgow fair I did repair, Some pleasure for to find, I own it was a pleasant place, Down by the flowery Clyde I own it was a pleasant place, For rich attire they wore, There's none so rare as can compare To the girls of the Shamrock shore. One evening fair to take the air, Down by yon shady grove, I heard some lads and lasses gay, A talking to their love It grieved me so rejoiced to see, As I had done before, All with that maid has my heart betrayed, That I left on the Shamrock shore. So now to conclude and make an end, My pen begins to fail, Farewell my hpnoured mother dear, And for me don't bewail. Farewell my honoured mother dear, And for me grieve no more, When I think long, I'll sing my song, In praise of the Shamrock shore. _ ft gy - -'~ f _it£_i £_A___ 9 London- H.

I would rather have fell-And died on the scaffold than linger in pain, Tortured and bound by the sad felon's chains, A convict for life I am doomed to remain, So old Erin I bid you adieu. 7 ■ ! Oh Erin, sweet Erin, my poor despised country, My heart fondly clings towards thee, So I left my dear mother, my friends and relations, In hopes that I would see them free. With health fast declining, afflicted and sore, From the land of Columbia I freely came o'er, But Erin, dear Erin, my sweet native shore, I for ever must bid you adieu. Like a gallant and true-hearted son of Hibernia, I strove for my country's cause, I was longing to see dear old Erin set free, From all cruel and tyrannic laws ! But by spies and informers, I alas ! was betrayed, And false declarations against me they made, I was sentenced to death, but by some friendly aid My life has been spared from the tree. At Kilmainham I was to be hanged, drawn, and quartered, And for my sad fate was prepared, But government yielded to the voice of the people, And agreed that my life should be spared But, oh ! 'twould been better, much better for me To end my existence and die on the tree, But a convict for life I am now doomed to be, So old Erin I bid you adieu. Farewell dearest mother, may the Lord above guard you And my gentle sisters so dear, May he comfort and bless you, and always caress you, And keep you from danger and fear. In the cause of my country I stood brave and bold, Regardless of all they could do, or my country I've lived - for my country I'll die, F So sweec Erin I bid you adieu.
