[OCR_toInput] THE RAMBLE THROUGH THE Agricultural Show Have you seen the sights and wonders, As you rambled to and fro . Have you seen the patent mangles, Buckets, churns, and milking pails ? Or have you seen the new machine For making babies' heads and tails ? Have you seen the banners flying From the villages close by I They are here to-day with better pay, Hurrah for th.3 Union ! they do cry. Have you seen the jolly ploughboys Drinking cyder, ale, or wine ? Or two hundred lushy tailors On the Knickerbocker line I Have you seen the pretty milkmaids, Ripe and ready for a lark ? How they cuddled the naughty ploughboys, As they went kome all in the dark. Have you seen old farmer Jones, Arm in arm with Polly Strong ? He looks as if she'd burst his boiler, He can hardly toddle along, Have you seen the ladies' chignons ? None can tell what is within, Some have got a hole in the middle, For the cat to kitten in. Oh what would bonny England do Without the men and lads that plough, They cause our yellow grain to grow, They reap and sow, they plough and mow. Here's to the pretty dairymaids, They have got cheeks like ablooming rose, They have left the cow and come to-day, Te see the Agricultural Show. London - H. P. SUCH, Machine Printer i Publisher, 177 Union-street, Borough, S.E. The pretty flowers and decorations, At the Agricultural Show. Have you seen the people rushing, Crushing, pushing, in the throng, All you've seen and all you havn't, I will tell vou in my song. Have you seen the lads and lasses, As you've rambled to and fro . Have you seen the sights and wonders At the Agricultural Show. Have you seen the flags and banners, With the shamrock and the rose I Or our Peg with a wooden leg, Treading on a farmer's toes . Have you seen the streamers flying From the tall Venetian poles . Have you seen young Dolly Varden, With her stockings full of holes ? Have you seen the cows and horses, With machines of every name, Did you see old farmer Williams, Puffing and blowing to catch the train ? Have you seen the farmer's daughter . This is true you may depend, She burst her stays and broke her garters, Trying to do the Grecian bend, Have you heard our splendid band ? It's as good as any in the land Have you seen Sir .Roger Tichborne Playing a whistle in a German band . Have you seen the fruit and flowers, At the Horticultural Show . Have you seen the Prince of Wales . 'Sot for Joseph ! oh dear, no !
