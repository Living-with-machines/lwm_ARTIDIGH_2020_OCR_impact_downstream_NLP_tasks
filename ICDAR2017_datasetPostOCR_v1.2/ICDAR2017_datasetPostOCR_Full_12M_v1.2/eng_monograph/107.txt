[OCR_toInput] SECT. II. CHAPMAN ON MARLOWE. 79 LXIII. TO SLEEP. Care-charmer Sleep, son of the sable Night, Brother to Death, in silent darkness born, Relieve my languish, and restore the light With dark forgetting of my care return, And let the day be time enough to mourn The shipwreck of my ill-adventured youth Let waking eyes suffice to wail their scorn, Without the torment of the night's untruth. Cease, dreams, the images of day-desires, To model forth the passions of the morrow Never let rising sun approve you liars To add more grief to aggravate my sorrow. Still let me sleep, embracing clouds in vain, And never wake to feel the day's disdain. - Daniel. LXIV. CHAPMAN ON MARLOWE. Then ho, most strangely-intellectual fire, That, proper to my soul, hast power to inspire Her burning faculties, and with the wings Of thy unsphered flame visitest the springs Of spirits immortal ! Now as swift as Time Doth follow Motion find the eternal clime Of his free soul, whose living subject stood Up to the chin in the Pierian flood, And drunk to me half this Musaean story, Inscribing it to deathless memory Confer with it, and make my pledge as deep, That neither's draught be consecrate to sleep Tell it how much his late desires I tender If yet I know not , and to light surrender My soul's dark offspring, willing it should die To loves, to passions, and society. - Chapman. From Chapman's continuation of Marlowe's unfinished poem, Hero and Leander, a paraphrase of the Greek poem supposed to be by Musaeus.
