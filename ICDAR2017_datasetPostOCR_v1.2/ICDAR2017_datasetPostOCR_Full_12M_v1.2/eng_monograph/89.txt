[OCR_toInput] SECT. II. Philomela's ode. 49 XXXII. PHILOMELA'S ODE. Sitting by a river's side, Where a silent stream did glide, Muse I did of many things, That the mind in quiet brings. I gan think how some men deem Gold their god and some esteem Honour is the chief content, That to man in life is lent. And some others do contend, Quiet none, like to a friend. Others hold, there is no wealth Compared to a perfect health. Some man's mind in quiet stands, When he is lord of many lands But I did sigh, and said all this Was but a shade of perfect bliss And in my thoughts I did approve, Nought so sweet as is true love. Love 'twixt lovers passeth these, When mouth kisseth and heart 'grees, With folded arms and lips meeting, Each soul another sweetly greeting For by the breath the soul fleeteth, And soul with soul in kissing meeteth. If love be so sweet a thing, That such happy bliss doth bring, Happy is love's sugared thrall, But unhappy maidens all, Who esteem your virgin blisses, Sweeter than a wife's sweet kisses. No such quiet to the mind, As true Love with kisses kind 4
