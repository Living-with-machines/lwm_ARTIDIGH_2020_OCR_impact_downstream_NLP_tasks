[OCR_toInput] SECT. II. FROM THE ESSAY ON MAN. 271 Lo the poor Indian ! whose untutored mind Sees God in clouds, or hears Him in the wind His soul, proud science never taught to stray Far as the solar walk, or milky way Yet simple nature to his hope has given, Behind the cloud-topt hill, an humbler heaven Some safer world in depth of woods embraced, Some happier island in the watery waste, Where slaves once more their native land behold, No fiends torment, no Christians thirst for gold. To be, contents his natural desire, He asks no angel's wing, no seraph's fire But thinks admitted to that equal sky, His faithful dog shall bear him company. Go, wiser thou ! and, in thy scale of sense, Weigh thy opinion against Providence Call imperfection what thou fanciest such, Say, Here he gives too little, there too much Destroy all creatures for thy sport or gust, Yet cry, if man's unhappy, God's unjust If man alone engross not heaven's high care, Alone made perfect here, immortal there Snatch from his hand the balance and the rod, Rejudge his justice, be the God of God. In pride, in reasoning pride, our error lies All quit their sphere, and rush into the skies. Pride still is aiming at the blest abodes, Men would be angels, angels would be Gods. Aspiring to be Gods, if angels fell Aspiring to be angels, men rebel And who but wishes to invert the laws Of order, sins against th' Eternal Cause. - Ep. i. Honour and shame from no condition rise Act well your part, there all the honour lies.
