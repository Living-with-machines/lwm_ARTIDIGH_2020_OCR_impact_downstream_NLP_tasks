This ilke worthy knight hadde ben also Somtyme with the lord of Palatye, Ageyn another hethen in Turkye And evermore he hadde a sovereyn prys. And though that he was worthy, he was wys, And of his port as meke as is a mayde. He nevere yit no vileinye ne sayde In al his lyf, unto no maner wight. He was a verray perfight gentil knight. But for to tellen you of his array, His hors was good, but he ne was nought gay. Of fustyan he werede a gepoun Al bysmotered with his habergeoun. For he was late ycome from his viage, And wente for to doon his pilgrimage. With him ther was his sone, a young Squyer, A lovyere, and a lusty bacheler, With lokkes crulle as they were leyd in presse. Of twenty yeer of age he was, I gesse. Of his stature he was of even lengthe, And wonderly delyver, and gret of strengthe. And he hadde ben sometyme in chivachye, In Flaundres, in Artoys, and Picardye, And born him wel, as of so litel space, In hope to stonden in his lady grace.
