[OCR_toInput] BK. IV. 424 AN ENGLISH ANTHOLOGY. Of brotherhood is broken time has been When, every day, the touch of human hand Dislodged the natural sleep that binds them up In mortal stillness and they ministered To human comfort. As I stooped to drink, Upon the slimy foot-stone I espied The useless fragment of a wooden bowl, Green with the moss of years, a pensive sight That moved my heart, recalling former days When I could never pass that road but she. Who lived within these walls, at my approach, A daughter's welcome gave me, and I loved her As my own child. Oh, Sir ! the good die first, And they whose hearts are dry as summer dust Burn to the socket.' - Wordsworth's Excursion, bk. i. CCCXXIV. SUNSET. Ere long the sun declining shot A slant and mellow radiance, which began To fall upon us, while, beneath the trees, We sat on that low bench and now we felt, Admonished thus, the sweet hour coming on. A linnet warbled from those lofty elms, A thrush sang loud, and other melodies, At distance heard, peopled the milder air. The old man rose, and, with a sprightly mien Of hopeful preparation, grasped his staff Together casting then a farewell look Upon those silent walls, we left the shade And, ere the stars were visible, had reached A village-inn, - our evening resting-place. -Ib.
