[OCR_toInput] THE LAMENTATION OF MICHAEL BARRETT. o I will unfold to young and old if you but lend an ear Good christians all both great and small, that live both far and near. To hear my lamentation will make you shed a tear, May the Lord have mercy on my soul, my hour in drawing near. My name is Michael Barrett, and the same I'll never disown, It's true I struggled night nd day to free the Sham-rock shore, I love the land that gave me birth, and the same will never deny, So it is for being an Irishman I am cordemned to die My parents rear'd me tender! - and very well it's know They gave me education for she 1 oly church of Rome Never thinking at that time that hanged I'd ever be, Tho' thousands through oppression flew unto America. The Lord will well reward them upon a future day, Who swore away the innocent livesby cdperjuiy There is Allen, Lurkin, and O'Brien, says Barrett I'll be four, Aud I'd freely die a thousand deaths to free the Sham-rock shore. My curse attend you, Mullany, of men you are the worst, Lono- live my noble counsel, for me he done his best, In vain he laboured hard to free me from the gallow tree, Against that perjured traitor, may the Lord look down on me. Farewell unto old Ireland, and this world I bid adieu My aallant countrymen let your hearts be firm and true And free old Ireland from her chains, the land which we adore. May the Almighty lend a helping hand and free the Shamrock shore. My lamentation to conclude and end my mournful song May every true-bred Irishman unite before it s long Ana free old Ireland from her chains, and away with tyranny, The Lord have mercy on my soul, I have do more to say. PRINTED FOR THE VENDORS Answer to the PROTESTANT It's of a few lines concerning the times, Come listen you Catholics every one, 25AP7 Although I am feeble I'll do my endeavours, To answer the boys of the Protestant drum. £sSTg9 Those lines t' v are heinous, and never blasphemous, Against cur bles ed Mother and her beloved Son, She is honomvuD Christians, despised by Philistines And insulted by those of the Protestant drum. When Satan inverted the new Reformation, He whispered Kiug Harry and thus 1 e did tay, Young Nancy is charming, take her to your as ms, And banish your doating Queen Catherine away. King Harry, Anne's fathe r, wl.o wed his own daughter But as from his cursed lust the Orange first spin- g That may we well wonder when churches he plannVl He then march's! to hell with his Prote.-tant drum. Those upstarts of preachers the curse of the reformation' Each one that could read took a bible in hand, The scrawls ot the nation they all became preachers, Like devils from hell they infested the land. The Protestant church it has reason to mourn, Since Catholic heroes are carrying the sway, There is Luther and Calvin in hell they're all burning, They are calling for help but they can't find no aid. Like devils iu flames tormented in chains, Callino. for water for to cool their tongues, And that is tbe portion of each Orange beagle, They're marching through hell with their Protestant drum. When King Harry departed, from the world started He called on St. Peter for to let him in, He says I am champion of the Reformation Besides, don't you know I'm a great Englishkmg. O King, says St Peter, you're the curse of the nation, . Ton denied Pope and Popery, and that you ve done, ' So flv from those gates and down to - straight, And rattle away with the Protestant drum. So now to conclude and finish these lines I think I have answered the Protestant, drum , If God in his mercy would open their eyes, They'd all become Catholics every one, We mav thank our Creator, he's our blessed Saviour, He supported our church against these vile clans, For 300 veai s, aud amidst terrors and fears, TJv s never put down by a Protestant Drum.
