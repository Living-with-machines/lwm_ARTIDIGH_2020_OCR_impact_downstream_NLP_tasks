[OCR_toInput] SECT I. MEN OF ENGLAND. 431 Has wrought a silence, from the store there shrills The cricket's song, in warmth increasing ever, And seems to one in drowsiness half lost The grasshopper's among some grassy hills. - Keats. cccxxxm. MEN OF ENGLAND. Men of England ! who inherit Rights that cost your sires their blood ! Men whose undegenerate spirit Has been proved on land and flood -By the foes you've fought uncounted, By the glorious deeds ye've done, Trophies captured - breaches mounted, Navies conquered - kingdoms won ! Yet, remember, England gathers Hence but fruitless wreaths of fame, If the freedom of your fathers Glow not in your hearts the same. What are monuments of bravery, Where do public virtues bloom ? What avail, in lands of slavery, Trophied temples, arch and tomb ? Pageants ! - Let the world revere us For our people's rights and laws, And the breast of civic heroes Bared in Freedom's holy cause. Yours are Hampden's, Russell's, glory, Sydney's matchless shade is yours, -Martyrs in heroic story, Worth a hundred Agincourts ! We're the sons of sires that baffled Crowned and mitred tyranny -They defied the field and scaffold For their birthright - so will we ! - Campbell
