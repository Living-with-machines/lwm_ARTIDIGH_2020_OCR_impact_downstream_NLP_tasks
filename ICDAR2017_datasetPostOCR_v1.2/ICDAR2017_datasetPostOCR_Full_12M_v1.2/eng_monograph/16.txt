Oh ! what shall I do to get rid of my pain, I wish to the Lord I was single again And, oh, that I had in my coffin been laid, Before I had married a silly young maid. To please her I called her my love and my dear, She frowns, and she calls me a silly old bear, And if I say nothing to settle the strife, She beats me within half-an-inch of my life.

When she comes to bed tm me she cannot lie still, But keeps me awake against my own will With pinching and kicking and rubbing my shins She puzzles my head to know what she means. One night she was dressing to go to the play, In fine silks and satins so costly and gay, To prevent me from going she played me a rig, And straightway set fire to my holiday wig. Now if she should sicken and happen to die, I think in my heart I should sicken with joy, For if she were dead it would end all my strife, I'd make myself happy the rest of my life. m I vLLm m m CRUEL7 MILLER.

I courted her six long months, a little now and then, I was ashamed to marry her being so young a man, Till at length she proved with child by me, and thus she then did say, 0 Johnny do but marry me, or else with love I die. I went unto her sister's house at eight o'clock at night, And little did this fair one know I owed her a spite, I asked her if she'd take a walk into the meadows gay, Andthere we'd sit talk awhile about ourweddingday. I took a stick out of the hedge and hit her on the crown The blood from this young innocent came trickling on the ground She onher bendedknees didfallandloudformercy cried, Saying, Johnny, dear, don't murder me, think of our poor child. I took her by the yellow locks and dragged her to the ground, And then to the river side where I threw her body down With blood from this young innocent my hands and feet were dyed, And if you'd seen her in her bloom, she was fit to be my bride. I went into my master's house at ten o'clock at night, ?iy master getting out of bed and striking a light, He asked and questioned me what dyed my hands and clothes ? I made a fit answer, I was bleeding at the nose. I then took up a candle to light myself to bed, And all that blessed long night my own true love lay dead, And all that blessed long night no sleep could I find, For the burning flames of torment all round my eyes did shine. In two or three days after, this fair maid was missed, 1 was taken on suspicion and into prison cast Her sister prosecuted me for my own awful doubt, Her sister prosecuted me for taking of her out. In two or three days after this fair maid was found, Came floating by her mother's door that was near to Wexford town The judge and the jury they quickly did agree, For the murder of my true love that hanged I should be.
