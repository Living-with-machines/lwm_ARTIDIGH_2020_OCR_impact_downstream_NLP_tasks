[OCR_toInput] bk. IV 448 AN ENGLISH ANTHOLOGY. CCCXLVIII. ODE ON A GRECIAN URN. Thou still unravished bride of quietness ! Thou foster-child of Silence and slow Time, Sylvan historian, who canst thus express A flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme What leaf-fringed legend haunts about thy shape Of deities or mortals, or of both, In Tempe or the dales of Arcady ? What men or gods are these ? what maidens loth ? What mad pursuit ? What struggle to escape ? What pipes and timbrels ? What wild ecstasy ? Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard Are sweeter therefore, ye soft pipes, play on Not to the sensual ear, but, more endeared, Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone Fair youth, beneath the trees, thou canst not leave Thy song, nor ever can those trees be bare Bold lover, never, never canst thou kiss, Though winning near the goal - yet, do not grieve She cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss, For ever wilt thou love, and she be fair ! Ah, happy, happy boughs ! that cannot shed Your leaves, nor ever bid the Spring adieu And happy melodist, unwearied, For ever piping songs for ever new More happy love ! more happy, happy love ! For ever warm and still to be enjoyed, For ever panting and for ever young All breathing human passion far above, That leaves a heart high sorrowful and cloyed, A burning forehead, and a parching tongue.
