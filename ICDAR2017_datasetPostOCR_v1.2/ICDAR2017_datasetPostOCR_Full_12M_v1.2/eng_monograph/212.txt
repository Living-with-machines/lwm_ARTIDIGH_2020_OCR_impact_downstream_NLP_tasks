[OCR_toInput] SECT. I. A NOCTURNAL REVERIE. 251 The wide, the unbounded prospect lies before me But shadows, clouds, and darkness rest upon it. Here will I hold - If there's a Power above us And that there is all Nature cries aloud Through all her works , he must delight in virtue And that which he delights in must be happy. But - when? - or where ? - This world was made for Caesar. I'm weary of conjectures. This must end them Laying his hajid on his sword. Thus am I doubly armed my death and life, My bane and antidote, are both before me. This in a moment brings me to an end, But this informs me I shall never die. The soul, secured in her existence, smiles At the drawn dagger, and defies its point. The stars shall fade away, the sun himself Grow dim with age, and nature sink in years But thou shalt flourish in immortal youth. Unhurt amid the war of elements, The wreck of matter, and the crash of worlds. 1713. - Addisou's Cato. ccix. A NOCTURNAL REVERIE. In such a night, when every louder wind Is to its distant cavern safe confined, And only gentle Zephyr fans his wings, And lonely Philomel, still waking, sings, Or from some tree, framed for the owl's delight, ' Excepting the Nocturnal Reverie of Lady Winchilsea, and a passage or two in the Windsor Forest of Pope, the poetry of the period intervening between the publication of Paradise Lost and the Seasons does not contain a single new image of external nature,' -Wordsworth, Lyrical Ballads, 1815.
