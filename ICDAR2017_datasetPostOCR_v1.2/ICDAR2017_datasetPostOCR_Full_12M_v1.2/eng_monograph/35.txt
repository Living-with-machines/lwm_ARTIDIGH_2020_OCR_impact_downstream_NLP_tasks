So then the devil kick'd up such a fume, And Black like a steamer flew out of the room He went to the river and sat on the hrink, And about Mr. Devil he often did think ! He gazed on the clouus, he gazed on the river. At the sight ot his shadow, oh ! how he did shiver -It's only my shadow, ' he said, with a grin, When behind came the devil and popp'd him bang in ! Then said the devil, Say will you be mine, Say that you will, or short is your time, •'All right, says old Black, I'm yours without fail, All right,'' says old Nick, catch hold of my tail. Then Black caught hold of his tail with a grin, The devil he fainted, and quickly fell in Then Black caught the devil a rap on the snout. Then crept to the side, and got himself out. Then Black got a rope and looped it so fine, And the devil's poor neck he got in a line, Black got on a ship that was coming that way, And the devil he keeps floating about to this day ? And all round about where the devil he sails, He seems very much frighten'd by all those black whales And for thirteen long weeks he was chased by a shark, Who bit off his tail in the way of a lark -The devil was seen t'other day in a fog, Riding in style on a slippery log, Making a shift with a shirt for a sail, For his rudder he lost when the shark took his tail. So now if you don't think my song it is true. I'll tell you kind friends what you'd better do, Why if to the truth you cannot agree, You'd better all go to the devil and see. TMOTHY Black was a man of good sense, His understanding was really immense-Bo I'm undertaking to tell this sad tale, Of Timothy Black who buried wholesale. The name of the place where this man he did live, Not knowing the name, no name will I give, It was somewhere about the American States, At least so an old Yankee Paper relates, Now Black was an undertaker by trade, And a very, a very good living he made ! He lived with the living, but lived by the dead, For he buried the whole of the People 'tis said. The friends of old Black they died every one, And Black I am told, buried every chum ! He buried six thousand twenty feet deep, And so busy was he that he'd no time to weep. He charged a good price and got paid in good time. So wishing 'em dead he thought was no crime ! In less than ten days all his friends they were gone, He gave way to despair and looked quite forlorn-There was only a dozen left in the whole place, And they were departing he quickly could trace ! They got very ill, tho' to cure 'em he tried, And day after day one of them died. He buried bis aunt, he buried his mother, 0 r , -. He buried his sister, he buried his brother, He buried his granny and children so dear, He buried his grand-dad, then buried his heir He buried his mutes, he buried his wife, He thought then he'd buried the whole of his strife, He buried his father and sister-in-law, He buried the rich and he buried the poor. He buried the parson, he buried the clerk, And he buried the whole of his kin like a shark I He laid his pals one by one on the shelf •Till at last he was lett to bury himself. Every where that he went no friend eould he see And he was as wretched as wretched could be, There was no one to ride, there was no one to walk, There was no one to drink, there was no one to talk. He buried his horse, he buried his cow. He buried his cat that used to moll-row, To live by himself this man he seemed cast He thought of the future, he thought of the past. He prayed for his wife, tho' she'd plagued him before, He prayed for a man just to open the door ! Then at the door he heard a loud kick, The door it flew open and in walked old Nick. He gazed on the figure with true delight, The devil he bowed so very polite, Black ran to the 6gure a friend to embrace, But he did not much like the look ot his face Then Black hopp'd about with glee and with joy, 'And ran for a bottle to treat the old boy ! All right. said the devil, I'll drink whh a friend. Por we shall be happy some day I depend. Then out of his pocket a paper he took, The colour of blood and made like a book-He pull'd out a pen and wrote a long line, And said Mr. Black bo so good as to sign. Then Black smelt a rat, and said very civil, I see Mr. Stranger that you are the devil The deTil, a devil will ne'er do for me, For I am sure Mr. Devil we couldn't agree
