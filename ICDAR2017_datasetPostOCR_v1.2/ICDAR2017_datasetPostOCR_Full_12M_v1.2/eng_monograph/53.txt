There's not a singer in the town, With such a charming voice, sirs, You can hear her well from Horsleydowrr, Bang up to Charing Cross, sirs Her hunting songs arc all the go, You should hear her ' Tantarara, ' '•' Whoop, whoop, and Tallyho, Where's the voice like Sarah's ? And when we're dull I must infer, To mirth she'll soon restore us She chants the Jolly Waggoner, And can't she sing out Churns ! The pipes and baccy then go round, The gatter then they hear her, She drinks till she sprawls' on the ground She likes her beer - does Sarah. She stands six feet within an inch, And if I attempts to thrash her, She can go in, sirs, at a pinch, A regular Tipton Slasher. She floors the Peelers too, iu shoals, The Bobbies can't al ■ear her, And as for carrying sacks of coals, There's none comes up to Sarah. She squints with both eyes in her head. Her nose is like a parrots, And all her hair it is as red As any bunch of carrots. We have no children, straight or halt, Some have a host like Pharaoh's I knows quite well it's not my fault, So in course it must be Sarah's. She takes an ounce of snuff a day, And I warrant fore the night's ont, She puts a dozen quarts of beer away, And smokes a dozen pipes out. For bacea I just now did roam, To the shop of Dan O' Hara, So good night, chaps, I'm going home, To smoke a pipe with Sarah. NO. 171.
