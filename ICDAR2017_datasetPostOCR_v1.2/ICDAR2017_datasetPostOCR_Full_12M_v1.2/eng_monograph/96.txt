[OCR_toInput] sect. ii. 1 61 BEAUTY, THE SYREN. XLI. SONNET. Since there's no help, come let us kiss and part, -Nay I have done, you get no more of me And I am glad, yea glad with all my heart, That thus so cleanly I myself can free Shake hands for ever, cancel all our vows, And when we meet at any time again, Be it not seen in either of our brows That we one jot of former love retain. Now at the last gasp of Love's latest breath, When his pulse failing, Passion speechless lies, When Faith is kneeling by his bed of death, And Innocence is closing up his eyes, Now if thou would'st, when all have given him over, From death to life thou might'st him yet recover ! 1593. - Drayton' s Idea. XLII. BEAUTY, THE SYREN. Ah, Beauty ! syren, fair enchanting good, Sweet silent rhetoric of persuading eyes Dumb eloquence, whose power doth move the blood, More than the words or wisdom of the wise Still harmony, whose diapason lies Within a brow the key which passions move To ravish sense, and play a world in love. What might I then not do, whose power is such ? What cannot women do that know their power ? What women know it not I fear too much How bliss or bale lies in their laugh or lour ? Whilst they enjoy their happy blooming flower, Whilst Nature decks them in their best attires Of youth and beauty, which the world admires. From Daniel's Complaint of Rosamond 1594 , out of 129 stanzas.
