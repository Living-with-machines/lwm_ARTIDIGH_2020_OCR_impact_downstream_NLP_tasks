And on I put my gear and mine array, And to a pleasant grove I gan to pass, Long or the bright sun uprisen was In which were oakes great, straight as a line, Under the which the grass so fresh of hue Was newly sprung, and an eight foot or nine Every tree well from his fellow grew, With branches broad, laden with leaves new, That springen out agen the sonne sheen, Some very red, and some a glad light green. Which, as me thought, was a right pleasant sight And eke the burdis songis for to hear, Would have rejoiced any earthly wight, And I, that couthe not yet in no manere Hearen the nightingale of all the vear, Full busily hearkened with heart and ear If I her voice perceive could anywhere. And at the last a path of little brede I found, that greatly had not used be For it forgrowen was with grass and weed, That well unneath a wighte might it see. Thought I, this path some whider go'th parde ! And so I followed till it me brought To a right pleasant herbir well ywrought That benched was, and with turves new Freshly turved, whereof the greene grass So small, so thick, so soft, so fresh of hue. That most like to green wool, wot I, it was The hedge also that yeden in compass, And closed in alle the green herbere With sycamore was set and eglatere.
