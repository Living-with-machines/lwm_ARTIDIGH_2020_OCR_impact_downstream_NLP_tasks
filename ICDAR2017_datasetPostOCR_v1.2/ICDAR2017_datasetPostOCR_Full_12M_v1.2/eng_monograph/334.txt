[OCR_toInput] SECT. I. BRIGHT STAR. 459 Perhaps the self-same song that found a path Through the sad heart of Ruth, when, sick for home, She stood in tears amid the alien corn The same that oft-times hath Charmed magic casements, opening on the foam Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn. Forlorn ! the very word is like a bell To toll me back from thee to my sole self! Adieu ! the Fancy cannot cheat so well As she is famed to do, deceiving elf! Adieu ! adieu ! thy plaintive anthem fades Past the near meadows, over the still stream Up the hill-side and now 'tis buried deep In the next valley-glades Was it a vision, or a waking dream ? Fled is that music - do I wake or sleep ? - Keats. CCCLV. BRIGHT STAR. Bright star ! would I were steadfast as thou art -Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night, And watching, with eternal lids apart, Like Nature's patient, sleepless Eremite, The moving waters at their priest-like task Of pure ablution round earth's human shores. Or gazing on the new soft fallen mask Of snow upon the mountains and the moors -No - yet still steadfast, still unchangeable, Pillowed upon my fair love's ripening breast, To feel for ever its soft fall and swell, Awake for ever in a sweet unrest, Still, still to hear her tender-taken breath, And so live ever, or else swoon to death. - Ib. Keats' last sonnet.
