'twere Kitty Jones. I up to Kitty then did roam, expecting she would speak, I hemmed and hawed, and bowed and scraped, and touched her on the cheek ! Says I, Miss Kitty, you know me, - at least I do suppose, When she turned r und, he turned and squared, and I turned up my nose ! Says he, Young man this lass is mine, so run you gaping clown, I sharply should ha' took him up - but lord ! he knocked me down , He right and left pitched into me, and swore he'd break my bones, He rolled me over in Ihe mud, and so did Kitty Jones. In twelve months after this event I met her with a child, She seized me by the collar then, and foamed with anger wild A policeman was on the spot and ready at a nod. She swore I was her infant's pa, and took me off to quod They wanted me to tip the cash, but I'd got none to tip, And so to prison they resolved that I should take a trip, To grind up corn they sent me there in spite o' all my moans, I served a year in Clerkenwell, and all through Kitty Jones.
