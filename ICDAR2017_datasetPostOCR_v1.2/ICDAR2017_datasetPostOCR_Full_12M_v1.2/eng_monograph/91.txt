[OCR_toInput] SECT II. THE SOUL'S ERRAND. 51 XXXIV. RETIRED THOUGHTS. Retired thoughts enjoy their own delights, As beauty doth in self-beholding eye Man's mind a mirror is of heavenly sights, ■ A brief wherein all miracles summed lie, -Of fairest forms and sweetest shapes the store, Most graceful all, yet thought may grace them more. The mind a creature is, yet can create, To nature's patterns adding higher skill Of finest works wit better could the state, If force of wit had equal power of will. Devise of man in working hath no end What thought can think another thought can mend. Man's soul of endless beauties image is, Drawn by the work of endless skill and might. This skilful might gave many sparks of bliss, And, to discern this bliss, a native light To frame God's image as his worth required, His might, his skill, his word, and will conspired. 1592. - Southwell. XXXV. THE SOUL'S ERRAND. Go, Soul, the body's guest, Upon a thankless errand ! Fear not to touch the best The truth shall be thy warrant. Go, since I needs must die, And give the world the lie. This has been traced in manuscript to 1593, but was first printed in Davidson's Poetical Rhapsody, second ed., 1608.
