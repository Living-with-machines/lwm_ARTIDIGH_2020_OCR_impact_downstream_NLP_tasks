Nor yet can time itself obtain for these Life's latest comforts, due respect and ease For yonder see that hoary swain, whose age Can with no cares except its own engage Who, propped on that rude staff, looks up to see The bare arms broken from the withering tree, On which, a boy, he climbed the loftiest bough, Then his first joy, but his sad emblem now. 1783. - Crabbe's Village. CCLXIV. ACTION, THE LIFE OF NATURE. By ceaseless action all that is subsists. Constant rotation of the unwearied wheel. That Nature rides upon, maintains her health. Her beaut -, her fertility. She dreads An instant's pause, and lives but while she moves. Its own revolvency upholds the world. Winds from all quarters agitate the air, And fit the limped element for use, Else noxious oceans, rivers, lakes and streams, All feel the freshening impulse, and are cleansed By restless undulation e'en the oak Thrives by the rude concussion of the storm •
