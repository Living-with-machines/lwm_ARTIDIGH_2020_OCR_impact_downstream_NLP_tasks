[OCR_toInput] SECT. II. CHARITIE. 491 Dear and more dear, though now Hidden from sight? Where they rejoice to be, There is the land for me Fly time, fly speedily, Come life and light ! 1843. - Lady Nairne. CCCXXXLV. CHARITIE. The beams of morning are renewed The valley laughs their light to see And earth is bright with gratitude, And heaven with Charitie. Oh ! dew of heaven oh ! light of earth, Fain would our hearts be filled with thee, Because nor darkness comes, nor death About the home of Charitie. God guides the stars their wandering way, He seems to cast their courses free, But binds unto Himself for aye, And all their chains are Charitie. When first He stretched the signed zone, And heaped the hills, and barred the sea, Then Wisdom sat beside His throne, But His own word was Charitie. And still through every age and hour, Of things that were and things that be, Are breathed the presence and the power Of everlasting Charitie. This first appeared in a small volume of poems published in 1S43 for private circulation. Mr. Ruskin obtained the Newdigate Prize at Oxford in 1839.
