But see, the Virgin blest Hath laid her Babe to rest Time is, our tedious song should here have ending Heaven's youngest teemed star Hath fixed her polished car, Her sleeping Lord with handmaid lamp attending And all about the courtly stable Bright-harnessed angels sit in order serviceable. -Milton.

Dear son of memory, great heir of fame, What need'st thou such weak witness of thy name ? Thou in our wonder and astonishment Hast built thyself a life-long monument. For whilst to the shame of slow-endeavouring art Thy easy numbers flow, and that each heart Hath from the leaves of thy unvalued book Those Delphic lines with deep impression took, Then thou our fancy of itself bereaving, Dost make us marble with too much conceiving And so sepulchered in such pomp dost lie, That kings for such a tomb would wish to die. - Ib. This was written in r630, but first appeared in the Shakspere Folio of r632, entitled 'An Epitaph on the admirable Dramatick Poet, W. Shakespeare '.
