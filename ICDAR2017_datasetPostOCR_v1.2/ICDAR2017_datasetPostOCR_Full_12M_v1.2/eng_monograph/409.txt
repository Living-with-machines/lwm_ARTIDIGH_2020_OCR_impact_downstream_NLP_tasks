In many ways the contrast between St. Pierre and the British towns we had visited was very marked - a contrast that other visitors to the Caribbees have not failed to notice - but not for a deed or a gift of the whole lovely Colombian Archipelago can I be induced to say one word that might maliciously be tortured into a reproach of the Anglo-Creoles for assuredly it does not lie in the mouth of any traveller who has been a welcome guest at the groaning tables of Kittefonians and Antiguans, or who has been entertained, as I afterward was, at the Ice House in Bridgetown, Barbados, to grumble or find fault even with the dust on the streets of people who keep their houses swept and garnished, their doors wide open, and their tables spread for the entertainment of foreigners, no matter whether their guests arrive in yacht or man-of-war or are cast away on their coasts by the wreck of clumsy merchantmen. It were churlish indeed to find fault with any custom or to dwell critically upon any shortcoming of these hospitable people, who, as hosts, live up to their green turtle.
