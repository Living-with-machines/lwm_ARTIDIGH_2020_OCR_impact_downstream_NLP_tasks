O'er thee, oh King ! their hundred arms they wave, Revenge on thee in hoarser murmurs breathe Vocal no more, since Cambria's fatal day, To high-born Hoel's harp, or soft Llewellyn's lay. I- 3-' Cold is Cadwallo's tongue, That hushed the stormy main Brave Urien sleeps upon his craggy bed Mountains, ye mourn in vain Modred, whose magic song Made huge Plinlimmon bow his cloud-topped head. On dreary Arvon's shore they lie, Smeared with gore, and ghastly pale Far, far, aloof the affrighted ravens sail The famished eagle screams, and passes by.

They do not sleep. On yonder cliffs, a grisly band, I see them sit, they linger yet, Avengers of their native land With me in dreadful harmony they join And weave with bloody hands the tissue of thy line.' 19. ' The image was taken from a well-known picture of Raphael, representing the Supreme Being in the vision of Ezekiel. There are two of these paintings, one at Florence, the other at Paris.' - Gray. 28. Hocl, a famous bard, son of Owen, prince of North Wales. Cadwallo, Urien and Modred were Welsh bards of the sixth century.
