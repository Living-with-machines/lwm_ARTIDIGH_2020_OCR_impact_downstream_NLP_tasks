[OCR_toInput] BK. II. AN ENGLISH ANTHOLOGY. 154 As the gay motes that people the sunbeams, Or likest hovering dreams, The fickle pensioners of Morpheus' train. But hail, thou Goddess, sage and holy ! Hail, divinest Melancholy ' Whose saintly visage is too bright To hit the sense of human sight, And therefore to our weaker view O'erlaid with black, staid Wisdom's hue Black but such as in esteem Prince Memnon's sister might beseem, Or that starred Ethiop queen that strove To set her beauty's praise above The Sea-nymphs, and their powers offended. Yet thou art higher far descended Thee bright-haired Vesta long of yore To solitary Saturn bore His daughter she in Saturn's reign Such mixture was not held a stain. Oft in glimmering bowers and glades He met her, and in secret shades Of woody Ida's inmost grove, While yet there was no fear of Jove. Come, pensive Nun, devout and pure, Sober, steadfast, and demure, All in a robe of darkest grain Flowing with majestic train, And sable stole of cypress lawn Over thy decent shoulders drawn. Come, but keep thy wonted state With even step and musing gait, And looks commercing with the skies, Thy rapt soul sitting in thine eyes There, held in holy passion still.
