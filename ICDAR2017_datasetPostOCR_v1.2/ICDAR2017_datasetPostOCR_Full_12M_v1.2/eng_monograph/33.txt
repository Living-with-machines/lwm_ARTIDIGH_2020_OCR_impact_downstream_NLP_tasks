ON n fine summer's morning the day was dawning, I wandered alone to breathe the fresh air, In a gloomy myrtle shade I met a fair maid, As she sat weeping and tearing her hair. Said I, blooming fair one, why dost thou mourn, Is your true love gone where he'll never return ? Your sad lamentati ns my feelings does burn, I thmk you're a daughter of Erin-go-britgh. She appeared much alarmed when I first approached her, The tears from her eyes in torrents did flow, Her cheeks that I once saw as red as the roses, Now they are decaying aud clouded with woe. Young man she replied, poor Erin's my mother, If I'm not mistaken, dear youth, you're my brother, Come mingle your tears and we'll comfort each other, And sing for the wrongs of Erin-go-bragh. You asked me the cause of my disconsolatmn, My tongue is 6carce able the same to relate, -I once had a linnet, the pride of all nations, But death has him taken aud sad is my fate Sweet were the rotes when he sung thro' the bowers, With his lovely green wings spreading over the flowers But here I am doomed to spend these dull hours, For the loss of O'Connell to Erin-go-bragh. In Munster he sung, through Cork and Tipperary, And many more places too tedious to name, My linnet he hover' d so brisk and so airy, The fowlers tn take him played many a scheme To the plains of Kildare we marched off so glorious, With our harmonious band and our linnet before us, For to hear his sweet notes, they were soft melodious For he sung nought but freedom to Erin-go-bragh. He sung in Kilkenny a tune that was pleasing, His notes they were charming, both lofty and shrill, Through Wexford and Wicklow he held monster meetings, And sweetly he sung on Tara's old hill He sung in Athlone it being the middle station, In hopes his notes would be heard through the nation, All his trials and afflictions he bore with great patienoe, And all for the love of Erin-go-bragh. BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL, beautiful, fairy-liie bells, How sweetly ye float o'er the wild flow'ry dells, There's a voice in each note of your eloquent chime, Which recals to the lone heart some happier time. Beautiful, beautiful, through the still vale, Borne on the wings of the soft balmy gale, Like music from fairyland hovering round, Soft echoes repeating the magical sound. Beautiful, beautiful, fairy-like bells, How sweetly ye float down the wild flow'ry delle In murmuring cadences dying away, Chiming farewell to the fast fleeting day. Beautiful, beautiful, telling of rest, Breathing of peace to the wanderer's breast, Waking the past with a tender regret, Till we weep on tbe clay that we fain would forget. Beautiful, beautiful, lyre-like bells, How many a sad tale your melody tells ! Tet to earth's weary pilgrims ye whisper of bliss, Of a world that is fairer and brighter than this. Beautiful, beautiful, fairy-like, c. O'Conneirs green Linnet. Continued. In Roscommon he sung and his notes were admired, The ladies of Dublin all loved his sweet voice, In Longford my linnet he shall be rewarded, For of all other songsters they made him their ohoiw. In famed Mullingar and Mayo he's recorded, In Limerick and Gal way he's lively regarded, I grieve lor his loss, but I hope he's rewarded, For seeking the rights of Eriu-go-bragh. She fell at my feet in a state of distraction, I done my endeavours her spirits to cheer, Said I, blooming fair maid, what makes you fjtfftV hearted ? For Ireland will flourish in this present year, Although your sweet linnet now lies at Glasnovea, His spirit has fled to the mansion of Heaven, Where a glorious reward for his toil he is given, For the love that he bore to •■! i Erin-go-bragh. g # 360. ♦
