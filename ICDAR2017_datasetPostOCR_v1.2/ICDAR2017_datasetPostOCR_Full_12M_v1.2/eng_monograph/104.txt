A . You are right, Justice, and you weigh this well Therefore, still bear the balance and the sword And I do wish your honours may increase Till you do live to see a son of mine Offend you, and obey you, as I did.

You did commit me For which I do commit into your hand The unstained sword that you have used to bear With this remembrance, - that you use the same, With the like bold, just, and impartial spirit, As you have done 'gainst me. There is my hand You shall be as a father to my youth My voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear And I will stoop and humble my intents To your well-practised wise directions. 1597. - King Henry IV., II. v. 2
