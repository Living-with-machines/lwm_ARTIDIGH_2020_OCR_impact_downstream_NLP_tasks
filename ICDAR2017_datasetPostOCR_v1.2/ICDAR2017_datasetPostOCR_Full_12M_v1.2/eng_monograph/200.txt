[OCR_toInput] BK. II 234 AN ENGLISH ANTHOLOGY. CXCV. MRS. ANNE KILLIGREW. TO THE PIOUS MEMORY OF THE ACCOMPLISHED YOUNG LADY. EXCELLENT IN THE TWO SISTER ARTS OF POESY AND PAINTING. AN ODE. Thou youngest virgin-daughter of the skies, Made in the last promotion of the blest Whose palms, new plucked from Paradise, In spreading branches more sublimely rise, Rich with immortal green above the rest Whether, adopted to some neighbouring star, Thou rollest above us in thv wandering race, Or, in procession fixed and regular, Movest with the heaven's majestic pace, Or, called to more superior bliss, Thou treadest with seraphims the vast abyss Whatever happy region is thy place Cease thy celestial song a little space Thou wilt have time enough for hymns divine, Since Heaven's eternal year is thine. Hear then a mortal Muse thy praise rehearse In no ignoble verse, But such as thy own voice did practise here, When thy first fruits of poesv were given To make thyself a welcome inmate there, While yet a young probationer And candidate of Heaven. Anne Killigrew died of small-pox in 1685, in her twenty-fifth year. Dryden's ode was prefixed to a posthumous edition of her poems. Stanzas 1 and 4 out of 10 are here given. Dr. Johnson says it is 'undoubtedly the noblest ode that our language ever has produced.' 'The first stanza may be pronounced absolutely faultless and incapable of improvement.' - Saintsbury.
