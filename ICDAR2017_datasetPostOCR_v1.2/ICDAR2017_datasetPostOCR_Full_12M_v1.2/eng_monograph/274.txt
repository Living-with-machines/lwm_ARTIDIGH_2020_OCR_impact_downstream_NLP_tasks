[OCR_toInput] bk. III. 338 AN ENGLISH ANTHOLOGY. CCLIII. SWEET AUBURN. Sweet Auburn ! loveliest village of the plain, Where health and plenty cheered the labouring swain, Where smiling spring its earliest visit paid, And parting summer's lingering blooms delayed Seats of my youth, when every sport could please, Dear lovely bowers of innocence and ease, How often have I loitered o'er thy green, Where humble happiness endeared each scene ! How often have I paused on every charm, The sheltered cot, the cultivated farm, The never-failing brook, the busy mill, The decent church that topped the neighbouring hill, The hawthorn bush, with seats beneath the shade, For talking age and whispering lovers made ! How often have I blessed the coming day, When toil remitting lent its turn to play, And all the village train, from labour free, Led up their sports beneath the spreading tree, While many a pastime circled in the shade, The young contending as the old surveyed And many a gambol frolicked o'er the ground, And sleights of art and feats of strength went round And still, as each repeated pleasure tired, Succeeding sports the mirthful band inspired These were thy charms, sweet village ! sports like these, With sweet succession, taught e'en toil to please These round thv bowers their cheerful influence shed These were thy charms - but all these charms are fled. In all my wanderings round this world of care, In all my griefs - and God has given my share -I still had hopes, my latest hours to crown, Amidst these humble bowers to lay me down
