[OCR_toInput] SECT. II. l'allegro. 151 Whistles o'er the furrowed land, And the milkmaid singeth blithe, And the mower whets his scythe, And every shepherd tells his tale Under the hawthorn in the dale. Straight mine eye hath caught new pleasures, Whilst the landscape round it measures Russet lawns and fallows gray, Where the nibbling flocks do stray Mountains on whose barren breast The labouring clouds do often rest Meadows trim with daisies pied Shallow brooks, and rivers wide Towers and battlements it sees Bosomed high in tufted trees, Where perhaps some beauty lies, The cynosure of neighbouring eyes. Hard-by, a cottage chimney smokes From betwixt two aged oaks, Where Corydon and Thyrsis met Are at their savoury dinner set Of herbs and other country messes, Which the neat-handed Phillis dresses And then in haste her bower she leaves, With Thestylis to bind the sheaves Or, if the earlier season lead, To the tanned haycock in the mead. Sometimes, with secure delight, The upland hamlets will invite, When the merry bells ring round, And the jocund rebecks sound To many a youth, and many a maid, Dancing in the chequered shade And young and old come forth to play
