[OCR_toInput] BK. Ill 254 AN ENGLISH ANTHOLOGY. Nourished two locks, which graceful hung behind, In equal curls, and well conspired to deck With shining ringlets the smooth ivory neck Love in these labyrinths his slaves detains, And mighty hearts are held in slender chains. With hairy springes we the birds betray. Slight lines of hair surprise the finny prey Fair tresses man's imperial race ensnare, And beauty draws us with a single hair. 17 14. - Pope ccxi HORACE, ODES. iv. 9. ADDRESSED TO ARCHBISHOP KING. Virtue concealed within our breast Is inactivity at best But never shall the Muse endure To let your virtues lie obscure Or suffer Envy to conceal Your labours for the public weal. Within your breast all wisdom lies, Either to govern or advise Your steady soul preserves her frame, In good and evil times the same. Pale Avarice and lurking Fraud, Stand in your sacred presence awed Your hand alone from gold abstains, Which drags the slavish world in chains Him for a happy man I own. Whose fortune is not overgrown And happy he who wisely knows To use the gifts that Heaven bestows Or, if it please the powers divine. Can suffer want and not repine.
