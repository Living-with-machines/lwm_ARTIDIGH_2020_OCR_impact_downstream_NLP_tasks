[OCR_toInput] bk. IV 492 AN ENGLISH ANTHOLOGY. By noon and night, by sun and shower, By dews that fall and winds that flee, On grove and field, on fold and flower Is shed the peace of Charitie. The violets light the lonely hill, The fruitful furrows load the lea Man's heart alone is sterile still, For lack of lowly Charitie. He walks a weary vale within, No lamp of love in heart hath he His steps are death, his thoughts are sin, For lack of gentle Charitie. Daughter of heaven ! we dare not lift The dimness of our eyes to thee Oh ! pure and God-descended gift, Oh ! spotless perfect Charitie. Yet forasmuch thy brow is crossed With blood-drops from the deathful tree, We take thee for our only trust, Oh ! dying Charitie. Ah Hope, Endurance, Faith, ye fail like death, But Love an everlasting crown receiveth, For she is Hope, and Fortitude, and Faith, Who all things hopeth, beareth, and believeth. - Ruskin. CCCLXXXVI. A BLESSING FOR EVE. Adam. Raise the majesties Of thy disconsolate brows, O well beloved, And front with level eyelids the To-come, And all the dark o' the world. . . .
