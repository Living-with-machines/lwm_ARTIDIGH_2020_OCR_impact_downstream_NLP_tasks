[OCR_toInput] SECT. I. l'allegro. 149 CXXIX. L'ALLEGRO. Hence loathed Melancholy, Of Cerberus and blackest Midnight born, In Stygian cave forlorn, 'Mongst horrid shapes, and shrieks, and sights unholy ! Find out some uncouth cell, Where brooding Darkness spreads his jealous wings, And the night-raven sings There, under ebon shades and low-browed rocks, As ragged as thy locks, In dark Cimmerian desert ever dwell. But come, thou Goddess fair and free, In heaven yclept Euphrosyne, And by men, heart-easing Mirth Whom lovely Venus, at a birth, With two sister Graces more, To ivy-crowned Bacchus bore Or whether as some sager sing The frolic wind that breathes the spring, Zephyr, with Aurora playing. As he met her once a-Maying There, on beds of violets blue, And fresh-blown roses washed in dew, Filled her with thee, a daughter fair, So buxom, blithe, and debonair. Haste thee, Nymph, and bring with thee Jest and youthful Jollity, Quips, and Cranks, and wanton Wiles, Nods and Becks, and wreathed Smiles, Such as hang on Hebe's cheek, And love to live in dimple sleek Spor! that wrinkled Care derides, And Laughter holding both his sides.
