[OCR_toInput] BK. III. 308 AN ENGLISH ANTHOLOGY. A soft responsive voice was heard at every close And Hope enchanted smiled, and waved her golden hair. And longer had she sung - but, with a frown, Revenge impatient rose He threw his blood-stained sword in thunder down, And, with a withering look, The war-denouncing trumpet took, And blew a blast so loud and dread, Were ne'er prophetic sounds so full of woe ! And, ever and anon, he beat The doubling drum with furious heat And though sometimes, each dreary pause between, Dejected Pity at his side, Her soul-subduing voice applied, Yet still he kept his wild unaltered mien, While each strained ball of sight seemed bursting from his head. Thy numbers, Jealousy, to nought were fixed Sad proof of thy distressful state ! Of differing themes the veering song was mixed And now it courted Love, now raving called on Hate. With eyes upraised, as one inspired, Pale Melancholy sat retired, And, from her wild sequestered seat, In notes by distance made more sweet, Poured through the mellow horn her pensive soul. And dashing soft from rocks around, Bubbling runnels joined the sound Through glades and glooms the mingled measure stole Or, o'er some haunted stream, with fond delay, Round a holy calm diffusing, Love of peace, and lonely musing, In hollow murmurs died away.
