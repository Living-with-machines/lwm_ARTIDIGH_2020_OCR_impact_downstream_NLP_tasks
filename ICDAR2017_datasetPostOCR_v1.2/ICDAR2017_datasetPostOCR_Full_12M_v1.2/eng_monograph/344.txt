[OCR_toInput] Tbk. IV. 482 AN ENGLISH ANTHOLOGY. As if but yesterday departed, Thou too art gone before but why, O'er ripe fruit, seasonably gathered, Should frail survivors heave a sigh ? e Mourn rather for that holy spirit, Sweet as the spring, as ocean deep For her who, ere her summer faded, Has sunk into a breathless sleep. No more of old romantic sorrows, For slaughtered Youth or lovelorn Maid ! With sharper grief is Yarrow smitten, And Ettrick mourns with her their Poet dead. - Wordsworth. CCCLXXVII. TO SOUTHEY. The dance of youth, O Southey, runs not round, But closes at the bottom of the room, Amid the falling dust and deepening gloom, Where the weary sit them down, And Beauty, too, unbraids, and waits a lovelier crown. We hurry to the river we must cross, And swifter downward every footstep wends Happy, who reach it ere they count the loss Of half their faculties and half their friends. - Landor. CCCLXXVIII. THE STREAM THAT HURRIES BY. The stream that hurries by yon fixed shore Returns no more The wind that dries at morn yon dewy lawn Breathes, and is gone .' Crabbe died 3rd F'eb., r832. Mrs. Hemans died 16th May. 1835-These verses were first published in the Cornhill Magazine, 1870.
