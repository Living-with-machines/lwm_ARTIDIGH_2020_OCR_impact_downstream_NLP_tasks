But could youth last, and love still breed, Had joys no date, nor age no need, Then these delights my mind might move To live with thee, and be thy love. - Raleigh. away all care and sung like a nightingale. Pier voice was good and the ditty fitted for it it was that smooth song which was made by Kit Marlowe, now at least fifty years ago. And the milk-maid's mother sang an answer to it, which was made by Sir Walter Raleigh in his younger days.' - Walton's Complete Angler 1653 . 6
