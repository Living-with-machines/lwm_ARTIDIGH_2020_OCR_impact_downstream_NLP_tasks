[OCR_toInput] BK. II. AN ENGLISH ANTHOLOGY. 202 Chaucer his sense can only boast, The glory of his numbers lost ! Years have defaced his matchless strain And yet he did not sing in vain. The beauties which adorned that age, The shining subjects of his rage, Hoping they should immortal prove, Rewarded with success his love. This was the generous poet's scope, And all an English pen can hope, To make the fair approve his flame, That can so far extend their fame. Verse, thus designed, has no ill fate, If it arrive but at the date Of fading beauty if it prove But as long-lived as present love. - Waller. CLXXI. FROM THE ODE TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY.' Bacon, at last, a mighty man, arose, Whom a wise King and Nature chose Lord Chancellor of both their laws, And boldly undertook the injured pupil's cause. Authority, which did a body boast, Though 'twas but air condensed, and stalked about Like some old giant's more gigantic ghost, To terrify the learned rout, With the plain magic of true reason's light He chased out of our sight, This ode was first published in Sprat's History of the Royal Society, 1667. The Royal Society was founded in 1662.
