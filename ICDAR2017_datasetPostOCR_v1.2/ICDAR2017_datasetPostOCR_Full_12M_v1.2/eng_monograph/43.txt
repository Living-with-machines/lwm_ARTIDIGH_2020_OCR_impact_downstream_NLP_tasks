[OCR_toInput] THE CONVICT MAID J H. Such, Machine Printer and Publisher 177, Union Street, Borough. YE London maids attend to me, While I relate my misery Thro' London streets I ofttimes strayed, But now I am a convict maid. In innocence I once did live, In all the joys that peace can give, But sin my youthful heart betrayed, And now I am a convict maid. To wed my lover I did try To take my masters property So all my guilt was soon displayed, -And I became a convict maid. Then I was soon to prison sent, To wait in fear my punishment CsSa When at the bar I stood dismayed, Since doomed to be a convict maid. At length the judge did me address, Which filled with pain my aching breast To Botany Bay you'll be conveyed, For seven years a convict maid. For seven years, oh ! how I sighed, While my poor mother loudly cried My lover wept, and thus he said, May God protect my convict maid. To you that hear my mournful tale, I cannot half my grief reveal No sorrow yet has been portrayed, Like that of the poor convict maid. Far from my friends and home so dear, My punishment is most severe My woe is great, and I'm afraid That I shall die a convict maid. I toil each day in grief and pain, In sleepless thought the night remain My constant toils are unrepaid, And wretched is the convict maid. Oh could I but once more be free, I'd ne'er again a captive be, But I would seek some honest trade, And never become a ccnyict maid. IRISH naosi APPLY The answer to- No Irish Need Apply? LISTEN now you Irishmen towhltsTsta rehearse, And remember being Irish to you is no disgrace ii you look at the advertisements which way you cast your eye, You'll find at every ' genteel • place- The Irish must apply. For it is our country they like, and a very good reason - Why They insert in their advertisements- The Irish must apply. No doubt they have been to Erin's merry land, Where every luxury was bestowed all with a bounteous hand, When a hearty welcome they had found, 'tis sufficient to imply, That they have been prompted for to say - The Irish must apply. And I think it a sufficient fact to convince both you and I, That the people are in the right who say - The Irish must apply. Then just a moment, if you please, the soldiers we will scan, And ask apart from prejudice, who are the bravest men ? In the Crimea, in China, aud in India I cry, England saw and echoed - The Irish must apply. Al tho' the brave great Wellington for ever has gone by, In order for such men again - The Irish must apply. Their statesmen too, England's premier, Lord Pal-mer ton I mean, Is one of England's proudest sons, of him we gladly sing, The Irish poets we admire, their beauty and their style, And for such excellence and wit- The Irish must apply. England boasts about her wealth, her greatness is her CI7 And for its being still maintained - The Irish must apply. Remember when the Queen to Ireland paid a visit, None but devoted Irish could display such loyal spirit With true-hearted joyous shouts that echoed to the sky, Showed that her Majesty in emergency,- For the Irish must apply. So now I will conclude, and bid you all good-bye, And say in every loyal, real good cause - The Irish must apply.
