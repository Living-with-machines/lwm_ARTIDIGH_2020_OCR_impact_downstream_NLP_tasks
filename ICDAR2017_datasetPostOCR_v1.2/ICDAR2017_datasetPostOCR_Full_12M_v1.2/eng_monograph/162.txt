In this monody the author bewails a learned friend, unfortunately drowned in his passage from Chester on the Irish seas, 1637 and by occasion forfeits the ruin of our corrupted clergy, then in their height. YET once more, O ye laurels, and once more, Ye myrtles brown, with ivy never sere, I come to pluck your berries harsh and crude, And with forced fingers rude Shatter your leaves before the mellowing year. Bitter constraint, and sad occasion dear Compels me to disturb your season due, For Lycidas is dead, dead ere his prime, Young Lycidas, and hath not left his peer Who would not sing for Lycidas ? he knew Himself to sing, and build the lofty rhyme. He must not float upon his watery bier Unwept, and welter to the parching wind Without the meed of some melodious tear. Begin then, sisters of the sacred well That from beneath the seat of Jove did spring, Begin, and somewhat loudly sweep the string Hence with denial vain and coy excuse, So may some gentle Muse With lucky words favour my destined urn And, as he passes, turn And bid fair peace be to my sable shroud. For we were nursed upon the self-same hill, Fed the same flock by fountain, shade, and rill.
