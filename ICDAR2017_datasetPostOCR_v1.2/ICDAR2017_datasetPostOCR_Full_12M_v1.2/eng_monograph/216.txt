[OCR_toInput] SECT. I. EPISTLE TO MR. ADDISON. 255 The man who infamy to shun Into the arms of death would run That man is ready to defend, With life, his country or his friend. 1718. Swift. CCXII. EPISTLE TO MR. ADDISON. OCCASIONED BY HIS ' DIALOGUES ON MEDALS '. See the wild waste of all-devouring years ! How Rome her own sad sepulchre appears ! With nodding arches, broken temples spread ! The very tombs now vanished like their dead ! Imperial wonders raised on nation spoiled, Where mixed with slaves, the groaning martyr toiled Huge theatres, that now unpeopled woods, Now drained a distant country of her floods Fanes, which admiring gods with pride survey, Statues of men, scarce less alive than they ! Some felt the silent stroke of mouldering age, Some hostile fury, some religious rage. Barbarian blindness, Christian zeal conspire, And Papal piety, and Gothic fire. Perhaps, by its own ruins saved from flame, Some buried marble half preserves a name That name the learned with fierce disputes pursue, And give to Titus old Vespasian's due. Ambition sighed she found it vain to trust The faithless column, and the crumbling bust Huge moles, whose shadow stretched from shore to shore, Their ruins perished, and their place no more ! Convinced, she now contracts her vast design, And all her triumphs shrink into a coin.
