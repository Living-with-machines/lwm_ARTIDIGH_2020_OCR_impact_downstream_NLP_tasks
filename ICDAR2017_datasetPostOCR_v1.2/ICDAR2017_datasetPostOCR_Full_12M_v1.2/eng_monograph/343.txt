[OCR_toInput] BK. IV 480 AN ENGLISH ANTHOLOGY. CCCLXXV. VAN ARTEVELDE'S LAMENT FOR JOHN OF LAUNOY. I never looked that he should live so long, He was a man of that unsleeping spirit, He seemed to live by miracle his food Was glory, which was poison to his mind And peril to his body. He was one Of many thousand such that die betimes, Whose story is a fragment, known to few. Then comes the man who has the luck to live, And he's a prodigy. Weigh chance with chance, And deem there's ne'er a one in dangerous times Who wins the race of glory, but than him A thousand men more gloriously endowed Have fallen upon the course a thousand more Have had their fortunes by haphazard wrecked Whilst lighter barks pushed past them to whom add A smaller tally, of the singular few Who, gifted with predominating powers, Bear yet a temperate will and keep the peace. The world knows nothing of its greatest men. - Sir Henry Taylor. CCCLXXVI. EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG When first, descending from the moorlands, I saw the Stream of Yarrow glide Along a bare and open valley, The Ettrick Shepherd was my guide. When last along its banks I wandered, Through groves that had begun to shed Their golden leaves upon the pathways, My steps the Border-minstrel led.
