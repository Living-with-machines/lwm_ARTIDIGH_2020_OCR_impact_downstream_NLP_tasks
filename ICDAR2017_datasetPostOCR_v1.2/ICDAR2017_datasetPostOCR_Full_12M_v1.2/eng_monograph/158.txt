[OCR_toInput] SECT. I. 161 DIALOGUE FROM COMUS. Far from the cheerful haunt of men and herds, And sits as safe as in a senate house For who would rob a hermit of his weeds, His few books, or his beads, or maple dish, Or do his gray hairs any violence ? But Beauty, like the fair Hesperian tree, Laden with blooming gold, had need the guard Of dragon-watch with unenchanted eye To save her blossoms, and defend her fruit, From the rash hand of bold Incontinence. You may as well spread out the unsunned heaps Of miser's treasure by an outlaw's den, And tell me it is safe, as bid me hope Danger will wink on Opportunity, And let a single helpless maiden pass Uninjured in this wild surrounding waste. Of night or loneliness it recks me not I fear the dread events that dog them both, Lest some ill-greeting touch attempt the person Of our unowned sister. Eld. Br. I do not, brother, Infer, as if I thought my sister's state Secure without all doubt or controversy Yet where an equal poise of hope and fear Does arbitrate the event, my nature is That I incline to hope rather than fear, And gladly banish squint suspicion. My sister is not so defenceless left As you imagine she has a hidden strength Which you remember not. Sec. Br. What hidden strength ? -Unless the strength of Heaven, if you mean that. Eld. Br. I mean that too, but yet a hidden strength, Which, if Heaven gave it, may be termed her own. 1 1
