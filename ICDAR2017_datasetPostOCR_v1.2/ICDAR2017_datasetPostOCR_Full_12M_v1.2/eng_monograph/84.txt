THE SEVEN DEADLY SINS. 43 And stared sterne on all that him beheld As ashes pale of hue, and. seeming ded, And on his dagger still his hand he held, Trembling through hasty rage when choler in him sweld. His ruffin raiment all was staind with blood Which he had spilt, and all to rags yrent, Through unadvized rashnes woxen wood For of his hands he had no governement, Ne cared for blood in his avengement But, when the furious fit was overpast, His cruel facts he often would repent Yet, wilfull man, he never would forecast How many mischieves should ensue his heedlesse hast. Full many mischiefes follow cruell Wrath ! Abhorred bloodshed, and tumultuous strife, Unmanly murder, and unthrifty scath, Bitter despight, with rancour's rusty knife, And fretting griefe, the enemy of life All these, and many evils moe haunt ire, The swelling Splene and Frenzy raging rife, The shaking Palsey, and Saint Fraunces fire. Such one was Wrath, the last of this ungodly tire. And, after all, upon the wagon beame, Rode Sathan with a smarting whip in hand, With which he forward lasht the laesy teme, So oft as Slowth still in the mire did stand. Huge routs of people did about them band, Showting for joy and still before their way A foggy mist had covered all the land And, underneath their feet, all scattered lay Dead sculls and bones of men whose life had gone astray. -The Faery Queene, i. 4.
