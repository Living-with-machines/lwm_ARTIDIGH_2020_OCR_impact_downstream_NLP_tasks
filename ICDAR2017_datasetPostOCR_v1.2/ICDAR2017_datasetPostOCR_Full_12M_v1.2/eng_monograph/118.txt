[OCR_toInput] BK. I. 92 AN ENGLISH ANTHOLOGY. Rather in power than use and keep thy friend Under thy own life's key be checked for silence, But never taxed for speech. What heaven more will, That thee may furnish, and my prayers pluck down, Fall on thy head ! Farewell ! 1602. - All's Well That Ends Well, i. 1 LXXVI. A FATHER'S ADVICE. Yet here, Laertes! Aboard, aboard, for shame! The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail. And you are staved for. There, my blessing with you. And these few precepts in thy memory See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue, Nor any unproportioned thought his act. Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar. The friends thou hast, and their adoption tried. Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel But do not dull thy palm with entertainment Of each new-hatched, unfledged comrade. Beware Of entrance to a quarrel but, being in. Bear it that the opposed may beware of thee. Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment. Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy, But not expressed in fancy rich, not gaudy For the apparel oft proclaims the man. Neither a borrower nor a lender be For loan oft loses both itself and friend. And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry. This above all - To thine own self be true And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man. Farewell ! my blessing season this in thee ! 1602. -Hamlet, i. 3
