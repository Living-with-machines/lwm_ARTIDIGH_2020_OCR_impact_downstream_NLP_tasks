My first lines are lines upon a sweetheart, after the style of Milton ■only altered a little by the Author - myself.

One night 'twas dark to the house I went, To see her was my intent But her mother pop'd in the way, And ax'd me what I meant 1 told her I her daughter lov'd, At wbich she bid me fly. To be used thus I thought 'twas best, To lay me down and die. To the Regent's canal I made my wav, To leap in I was about, 3ut a second thought assured me, I should feel much better out. So home I went, a letter sent, Next day to say I thought her A faithless one, and she'd me undone, The wooden les'd woman's daughter. So Billy Nuts, c. Now Billy Nuts writes on sheeps' heads,-And lines on bugs and fleas too, And I've some lines that excel his.

Lines on Bugs.- Manchester Ones. Spoken. Stav down stairs till you've made dl things right When you're ready to get to bed lay hold of a light, Stalk n. tairs, but stay on the first flight, Then with carving knife you'll be all right Then when the bugs they heave in sight, For my rhyming is nearly over But before I go, I'll tell you my woe, About Miss Jemima Clover. She swore she loved, Yet false it proved 'Tis as true as I'm a Poet And how she acted unto me. 'Tis fit that you should know it. Lines on a false wife.

Spoken.- 'Twas in the middle of October 1852, When this false woman I met by Kew 'Tis true every word what I tell you, At me a sheepish eye she threw, And she says Oh Jimmy, I must have you, So I consented in a day or two So we went to Church aud sat in a Pew, Till the Parson came, he tipped with' Q, And fastened us together as tight as glue. But months had scarcely passed a few, When this false woman turned out a shrew And to my bed she proved untrue 'Twas then I in a passion flew, This weapon from my breast I drew, And the first opportunity I tell to you, I'll olunse it into a dish of Irish stew. - 6 So Billy Nuts, e.
