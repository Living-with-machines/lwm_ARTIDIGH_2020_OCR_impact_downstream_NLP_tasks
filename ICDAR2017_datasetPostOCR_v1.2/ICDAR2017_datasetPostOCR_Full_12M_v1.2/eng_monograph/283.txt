Go then ! and see them rising with the sun, Through a long course of daily toil to run See them beneath the dog-star's raging heat, When the knees tremble and the temples beat Behold them, leaning on their scythes, look o'er The labour past, and toils to come explore See them alternate suns and showers engage, And hoard up aches and anguish for their age Through fens and marshy moors their steps pursue, When their warm pores imbibe the evening dew Then own that labour ma ' as fatal be To these thy slaves, as thine excess to thee. Amid this tribe too oft a manly pride Strives in strong toil the fainting heart to hide There may you see the youth of slender frame Contend with weakness, weariness, and shame Yet, urged along, and proudly loth to yield, He strives to join his fellows of the field Till long-contending nature droops at last, Declining health rejects his poor repast. His cheerless spouse the coming danger sees, And mutual murmurs urge the slow disease. Yet grant them health 'tis not for us to tell, Though the head droops not, that the heart is well Or will you praise that homely, healthy fare, Plenteous and plain, that happy peasant's share!
