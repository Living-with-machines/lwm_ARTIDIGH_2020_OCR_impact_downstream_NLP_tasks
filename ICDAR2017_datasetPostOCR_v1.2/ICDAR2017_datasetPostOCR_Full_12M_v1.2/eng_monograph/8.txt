[OCR_toInput] HAVE YOU SEEN MY MISSUS. YOU'VE heard my children two, Seeking for each other, My daughter left home first, Soon followed by her brother But there never was so sad And wicked a world as this is, My family all are mad, For now I've lost my Missus. Toora loo ra la, toora loo ra loddy, c. I've studied well my home, From the first time I did woo her, But never thought she'd roam, Such a husband I'd been to her She's taken all the plate, But far much worse than this is I fear she's got a mate, Now have you seen my Missus ? Since I saw her last, None know what I suffer, Every one I ask, Calls me poor old Buffer 25AP78 K I could see her now, xhi y I'd smother her with kisses, I'm a wretched man I vow, Now have you seen my Missus ? She's took my watch and purse. A case with ring and pin in, And then to make it worse, Pawned every bit of linen I could forgive her that, To enjoy the married blisses, But I am losing all my fat, Since I have lost my Missus. That wretched home of mine, I cannot bear to enter, For there's her portrait fine, Hanging in the centre I oft gaze at the head, And fancy nought amiss is, Till I tumble into bed, It's then I miss my Missus. Wretched then I lay, Till the morn is beaming, And when I fall asleep, Strange things am I dreaming I awoke quite full of qualms, A hard case you'll say this is, With the bolster in my arms, Instead of having Missus. Her bonnet is a poke, With a light blue feather in it, She wears a Polka cloak, And sings like any linnet Should you a woman meet, With such a dross as this is, A bottle I'll stand treat, If you'll bring back my Missus.

S.E LOUD howled each Irish mourner That went to Paddy's wake, The house in every corner, They made to twist and shake To view Pat in his shroud The neighbours now did crowd, With squalls and cries, They rent the skies, Why did you die ? oh ! oh ! The house began to shiver, The stacks of chimnies bent, The rain just like a river, Through every tile-hole went While they sat on the floor, With Paddy placed before, Then each one said, To wake the dead, Why did you die ? oh ! oh ! The time soon came for starting, To put Pat in his grave, Then each one put their part in, And sung a doleful stave, Then screwed Pat in his shell, With tobacco and pipes as well Then each did moan, He's dead and gone, Why did you die ? oh ! oh ! With Paddy on their shoulders, Off to the grave they flew, And all the near beholders Kicked up a hubbaboo They down'd him with a whack, Which made the coffin crack, Then each did cry, Good-bye, good-bye, Why did you die ? oh ! oh ! ■ AEi? i i
