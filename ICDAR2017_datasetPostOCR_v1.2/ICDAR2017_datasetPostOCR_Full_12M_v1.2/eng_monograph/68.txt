By him lay heavy Sleep, Cousin of Death, Flat on the ground, and still as any stone, A very corpse, save yielding forth a breath, Small keep took he whom Fortune frowned on, Or whom she lifted up into the throne Of high renown, but as a living death, So, dead alive, of life he drew the breath. The body's rest, the quiet of the heart, The travail's ease, the still night's feere t was he, And of our life in earth the better part, Reaver of sight, and yet in whom we see Things oft that tide, and oft that never be Without respect, esteeming equally King Croesus' pomp, and Irus' poverty. And next in order sad Old Age we found, His beard all hoar, his eyes hollow and blind, With drooping cheer still poring on the ground, As on the place where nature him assigned To rest, when that the Sisters had untwined His vital thread, and ended with their knife The fleeting course of fast declining life. There heard we him with broke and hollow plaint Rue with himself his end approaching fast, And all for nought his wretched mind torment. With sweet remembrance of his pleasures past, And fresh delights of lusty youth forewast. Recounting which, how would he sob and shriek! And to be young again of Jove beseek. From the Induction to the Mirror of Magistrates 1563 , out of seventy-nine stanzas. Companion.
