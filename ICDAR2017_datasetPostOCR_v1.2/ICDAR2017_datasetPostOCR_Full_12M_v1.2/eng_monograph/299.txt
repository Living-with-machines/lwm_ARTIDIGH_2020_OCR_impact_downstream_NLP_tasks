[OCR_toInput] SECT. I. 383 SONNET TO MILTON. For of the wholly common is man made, And custom is his nurse ! Woe then to them Who lay irreverent hands upon his old House furniture, the dear inheritance From his forefathers. For time consecrates And what is grey with age becomes religion. Be in possession, and thou hast the right, And sacred will the many guard it for thee ! - Coleridge. CCLXXXIX. THE SONNET'S SCANTY PLOT OF GROUND. Nuns fret not at their convent's narrow room And hermits are contented with their cells And students with their pensive citadels Maids at the wheel, the weaver at his loom, Sit blithe and happy bees that soar for bloom, High as the highest peak of Furness Fells, Will murmur by the hour in foxglove bells. In truth, the prison, unto which we doom Ourselves, no prison is and hence for me, In sundry moods, 'twas pastime to be bound Within the sonnet's scanty plot of ground Pleased if some souls, for such there needs must be Who have felt the weight of too much liberty, Should find short solace there, as I have found. - Wordsworth. ccxc. SONNET TO MILTON Milton ! thou shouldst be living at this hour England hath need of thee she is a fen Of stagnant waters altar, sword, and pen, Fireside, the heroic wealth of hall and bower, Have forfeited their ancient English dower
