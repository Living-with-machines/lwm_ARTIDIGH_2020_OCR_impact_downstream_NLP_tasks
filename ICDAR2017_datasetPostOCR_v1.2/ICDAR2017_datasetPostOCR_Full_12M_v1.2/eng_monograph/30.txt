[OCR_toInput] THE SONG OP THE QUIRT ITJjESflTH fingers weary and worn, ■ With eyelids heavy and red, A woman sat in unwomanly rags, Plying- her needle and thread. Siilch, stitch, stitch, In poverty, hunger, and dirt, And still with a voice of dolorous pitch, She sang the song of the Shirt. Work, work, work, While the cock is crowing aloof, Aud work, work, work, Till the stars shine through the roof O it is better to be a slave, Along with the turban'd Turk, Where woman has never a soul to save, If this is Christian work. Work, work, work, Till the eyes are heavy and dim, Work, work, work, Till the brain begins to swim. Seam, gusset, and band, Band, gusset, and seam, Ktra-c S Till over the buttons I fall asleep, And sew them on in a dream. O men with sisters dear, O men with brothers and wives, It is no better than wearing out, Some human creatures' lives. Stitch, stitch, stitch, In poverty, hunger, and dirt, Sewing at once with a double thread, A shroud as well as a shirt. But why do I talk of death, That phantom of grizzly bone, I hardly fear his terrible shape, It seems so like my own It seems so like my own, Because of the fasts I keep, O God ! that bread should be so dear, And flesh and blood so cheap. Work work, work, My labour never flags, And what are its wages ? - a bed of straw, A crust of bread, and - rags. -That shattered roe-f and naked floor, A table - a broken chair, Aud the wall so blank, my shadow I thank, For sometimes falling there. With fingers heavy and worn, With eyelids heavy and red, A woman sat in unwomanly rags, Plying her needle and thread. Stitch, stitch, stitch, In poverty, hunger, and dirt, Would that its tones could reach the rich She sang the Song of the Shirt. Young William OF THE London - H. P.
