[OCR_toInput] BK. IV. AN ENGLISH ANTHOLOGY. 430 CCCXXXI. THE GRASSHOPPER AND THE CRICKET. Green little vaulter in the sunny grass, Catching your heart up at the feel of June, Sole voice that's heard amidst the lazy noon, When ev'n the bees lag at the summoning brass And you, warm little housekeeper, who class With those who think the candles come too soon, Loving the fire, and with your tricksome tune Nick the glad silent moments as they pass O sweet and tiny cousins, that belong, One to the fields, the other to the hearth, strong Both have your sunshine both, though small, are At your clear hearts, and both seem given to earth To sing in thoughtful ears this natural song, -In doors and out, summer and winter, - mirth. 1816. - Leigh Hunt. cccxxxn. THE GRASSHOPPER AND THE CRICKET. The poetry of earth is never dead When all the birds are faint with the hot sun, And hide in cooling trees, a voice will run From hedge to hedge about the new-mown mead That is the grasshopper's - he takes the lead In summer luxury, - he has never done With his delights for when tired out with fun, He rests at ease beneath some pleasant weed. The poetry of the earth is ceasing never On a lone winter evening, when the frost Cowden Clarke tells us, in his Recollections, that when he was on a visit to Leigh Hunt in Dec., 1S16, Hunt challenged Keats to write a sonnet on the grasshopper and the cricket. Keats finished his first.
