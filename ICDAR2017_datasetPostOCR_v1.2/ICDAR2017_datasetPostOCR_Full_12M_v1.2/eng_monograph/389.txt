[OCR_toInput] ADAT AT ANTIGUA. 73 Accounts of Slave-compensation Claims, printed by the British House of Commons in 183S, I made a few notes that may not be uninterest ing. In 1834 slavery was abolished in all the possessions of Great Brit ain. Parliament voted a gross sum, which was distributed among owners of slaves as compensation for setting their blacks free. The negroes were divided into classes according to the kind of labor for which they were fitted, and a value was set upon each class by valuers, sworn faithfully to perform their duties. Thus, in Antigua, head-people were valued at £144 9s. 8 d. trades-people, £112 inferior trades-people, £59 field-hands, £94 inferior field-hands, £31 domestics, £82. The valuations differed in different islands for instance, head-people in Jamaica were valued at £78 in St. Kitt's, £80 in Grenada, £120 and so on. Children under six years of age on August 1, 1834 the day set for the emancipation of the slaves , were valued at £13 17s. 4d. aged, deceased, or otherwise non-effective adults, at £10 18s. 5-Jd. By arbi tration the rates of compensation were determined, and, like the valu ations, differed in different islands - head-people being rated as fol lows In Jamaica, £31 in Antigua, £34 in St. Kitt's, £80 in Gre nada, £41 the compensation for other slaves being in proportion. The commissioners appointed to carry out the act of Parliament took nearly four years to complete their labors. From their final report it appears that the total sum expended under the act was £18,669,401 10s. 7d., leaving contested unpaid claims to the amount of £1,330, 598 9s. 5d. The total expense of the commission was £61,147 13s. 2d. that is to say, a little over one-third of one per cent, of the money dis bursed by the commissioners. The Antiguans, to their credit be it said, were the first to carry out the provisions of the act of Parliament. As I studied the columns of figures of this grand book-account, the record of the noblest financial transaction ever negotiated by the men of any nation, I could not help indulging a feeling of pride that I was a kinsman of the nation of shopkeepers.
