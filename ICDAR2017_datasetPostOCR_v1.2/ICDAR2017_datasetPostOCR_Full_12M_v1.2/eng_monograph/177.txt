[OCR_toInput] SECT. II. J hudibras' religion. 199 A sect whose chief devotion lies In odd perverse antipathies In falling out with that or this, And finding somewhat still amiss More peevish, cross, and splenetic, Than dog distraught or monkey sick That with more care keep holiday The wrong, than others the right way Compound for sins they are inclined to, By damning those they have no mind to. Still so perverse and opposite, As if they worshipped God for spite The self-same thing they will abhor One way, and long another for Free-will they one way disavow, Another, nothing else allow All piety consists therein In them, in. other men all sin Rather than fail, they will defy That which they love most tenderly Quarrel with minced pies, and disparage Their best and dearest friend, plum-porridge Fat pig and goose itself oppose, And blaspheme custard through the nose. The apostles of this fierce religion, Like Mahomet's, were ass and widgeon, To whom our knight, by fast instinct Of wit and temper, was so linked, As if hypocrisy and nonsense Had got th' advowson of his conscience. - Butler. The ass is the milkwhite beast, called Alborach, on which Maho met rode to heaven and the widgeon, or pigeon, he had trained to pick seeds out of his ear so that it might be thought that it was communicating an inspired message to him,
