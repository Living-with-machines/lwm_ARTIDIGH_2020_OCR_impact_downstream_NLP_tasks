[OCR_toInput] BK. III. AN ENGLISH ANTHOLOGY. 292 CCXXXI. NIGHT THOUGHTS. Tired Nature's sweet restorer, balmy Sleep ! He, like the world, his ready visit pays Where Fortune smiles the wretched he forsakes Swift on his downy pinion flies from woe, And lights on lids unsullied with a tear. From short as usual and disturbed repose I wake how happy the - who wake no more ! Yet that were vain, if dreams infest the grave. I wake, emerging from a sea of dreams Tumultuous where my wrecked desponding thought From wave to wave of fancied misery At random drove, her helm of reason lost. Though now restored, tis only change of pain -A bitter change ! - severer for severe The day too short for my distress and Night, E'en in the zenith of her dark domain, Is sunshine to the colour of my fate. Night, sable goddess, from her ebon throne, In rayless majesty, now stretches forth Her leaden sceptre o'er a slumbering world. Silence how dead ! and darkness how profound ! Nor eye nor listening ear an object finds Creation sleeps, sis as the general pulse Of life stood still, and Nature made a pause, An awful pause ! prophetic of her end. And let her prophecy be soon fulfilled Fate ! drop the curtain I can lose no more. - Young. These are the opening lines of Young's long didactic poem consisting of nine Books or Nights, published 1742-1744.
