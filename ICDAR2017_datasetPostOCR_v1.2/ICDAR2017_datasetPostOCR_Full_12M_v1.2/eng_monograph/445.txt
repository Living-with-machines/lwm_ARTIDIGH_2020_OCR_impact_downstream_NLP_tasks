It must not be imagined, however, from my spinning such yarns concerning vultures and other frightful creatures, that while at Port of Spain I supped full of horrors nor do I intend to convey the idea that Trinidad alone, of all the places I visited in the West Indies, is in particular infested by monstrosities that prey on mankind. At Mar-tinique I could have scared up a fer-de-lance, as the vile serpent is called, whose bite is as deadly as that of the cobra. At any of the islands I could, no doubt, have unearthed grewsome and venom-ous things, tarantulas, scorpions, centipedes, and chigoes. All these dreadful things, and many more, are to be seen in the Caribbees, no doubt, but I had as soon thought of going in quest of them as of go-ing a-slumming in the lowest, filthiest dives of a great city. I had, moreover, no craving to disgust my sight, nor morbid desire to insult my sensibilities, by visiting the lepers in their lazar-houses, or the wretched coolies smitten with elephantiasis, nor to gratify my curiosity by invading the awful seclusion of the Yaws Hospitals, where living souls are held in torment by festering bodies that might better in mercy be laid quick in the earth. I saw none of all these awful sights, for I took heed where I set my feet, going gingerly in the long grass or among the weeds, and in this way, avoiding the scorpions and other reptiles, I went my way in peace and quietness.

Life was delicious and sensuous.
