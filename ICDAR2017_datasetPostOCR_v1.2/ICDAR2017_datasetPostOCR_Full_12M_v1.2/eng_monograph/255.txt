[OCR_toInput] SECT. III. GRAY'S ELEGY. 313 Still raise for good the supplicating voice, But leave to Heaven the measure and the choice Safe in His power, whose eyes discern afar The secret ambush of a specious prayer, Implore His aid, in His decisions rest, Secure, whate'er He gives, He gives the best. Yet when the sense of sacred presence fires, And strong devotion to the skies aspires, Pour forth thy fervours for a healthful mind, Obedient passions, and a will resigned For love, which scarce collective man can fill For patience, sovereign o'er transmuted ill For faith, that, panting for a happier seat, Counts death kind Nature's signal of retreat These goods for man the laws of Heaven ordain These goods He grants, who grants the power to gain With these celestial Wisdom calms the mind, And makes the happiness she does not find. - Johnson.
