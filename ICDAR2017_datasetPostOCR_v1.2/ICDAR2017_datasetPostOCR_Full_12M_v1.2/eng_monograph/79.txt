Sudden upriseth from her stately place The royall Dame, and for her coche doth call All hurtlen forth and she with princely pace, As faire Aurora in her purple pall Out of the East the dawning day doth call.

So forth she comes, and to her coche does clyme, Adorned all with gold and girlonds gay, That seemed as fresh as Flora in her prime And strove to match, in roy .ill rich array, Great Juno's golden chayre the which, they say, The gods stand gazing on, when she does ride To Jove's high hous through heaven's brasspaved way Drawne of fayre Pecocks, that excell in pride, And full of Argus eyes their tayles dispredden wide. But this was drawne of six unequall beasts, On which her six sage counsellours did rvde, Taught to obay their bestiall beheasts. With like conditions to their kindes applyde, Of which the first, that all the rest did guvde. Was sluggish Idlenesse, the nourse of sin Upon a slouthfull Asse he chose to rvde, Arrayd in habit blacke, and amis thin, Like to an holy Monck, the service to begin. The ' Royal Dame ' is Duessa, or Pride, and she and her six coun sellors represent the seven deadly sins.
