[OCR_toInput] SECT. IV. HOPE. 365 CCLXXIV. AT DOVER CLIFFS. On these white cliffs, that, calm above the flood, Uplift their shadowing heads, and, at their feet, Scarce hear the surge that has for ages beat, Sure many a lonely wanderer has stood And, whilst the lifted murmur met his ear, And o'er the distant billows the still eve Sailed slow, has thought of all his heart must leave To-morrow of the friends he loved most dear Of social scenes, from which he wept to part But if, like me, he knew how fruitless all The thoughts that would full fain the past recall, Soon would he quell the risings of his heart, And brave the wild winds and unhearing tide, -The world his country, and his God his guide. cclxxv. -Bowles. HOPE. As one who, long by wasting sickness worn, Weary has watched the lingering night, and heard Heartless the carol of the matin bird Salute his lonely porch, now first at morn Goes forth, leaving his melancholy bed He the green slope and level meadow views, Delightful bathed with slow-ascending dews Or marks the clouds, that o'er the mountain's head In varying forms fantastic wander white Or turns his ear to every random song, Heard the green river's winding marge along, The whilst each sense is steeped in still delight With such delight, o'er all my heart I feel, Sweet Hope ! thy fragrance pure and healing incense steal ! - Ib. withdrawn chiefly by the genial influence of a style of poetry, so tender and yet so manly, so natural and real, and yet so dignified and harmonious as the sonnets of Mr. Bowles.' - Coleridge.
