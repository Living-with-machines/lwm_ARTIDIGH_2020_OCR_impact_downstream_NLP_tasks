[OCR_toInput] BK. II. AN ENGLISH ANTHOLOGY. 140 Fine nets and stratagems to catch us in, Bibles laid open, millions of surprises Blessings before hand, ties of gratefulness, The sound of Glory ringing in our ears Without, our shame within, our consciences Angels and grace, eternal hopes and fears ! Yet all these fences, and their whole array, One cunning bosom-sin blows quite away. - Herbert. cxxi. A WISH. This only grant me, that my means may lie Too low for envy, for contempt too high. Some honour I would have, Not from great deeds, but good alone. The unknown are better than ill-known Rumour can ope the grave. Acquaintance I would have, but when't depends Not on the number, but the choice of friends. Books should, not business, entertain the light, And sleep, as undisturbed as death, the night. My house a cottage, more Than palace, and should fitting be For all my use, not luxury. My garden painted o'er With Nature's hand, not art's and pleasures yield, Horace might envy in his Sabine field. Thus would I double my life's fading space, For he that runs it well, twice runs his race And in this true delight, These unbought sports, this happy state, Out of eleven stanzas. Written in 163 1 when Cowley was only thirteen years old, and published in Poetical Blossoms, 2nd ed., 1636.
