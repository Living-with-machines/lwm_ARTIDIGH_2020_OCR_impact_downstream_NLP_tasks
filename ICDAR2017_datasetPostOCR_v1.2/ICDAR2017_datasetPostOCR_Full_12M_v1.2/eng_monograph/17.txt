She was gay, young and handsome, attractive and keec, A blooming young damsel about seventeen She was courted by a ploughboy who on hev did smile, Was bonny young Kate of the Emerald Isle. He was envied by squires and lords of renown, On the hills with her lover she often sat down, While the birds on the bushes did chattel- awhile, Dennis loved bonny Kate of the Emerald Isle. As they tript o'er the meadows one morning so soon, When tbe pink and the violet were all in full bloom, There a blooming young rose on the lovers did. smile, A young squire met Kate of the Emerald Isle. He said, blooming damsel, can I make so bold, To desire your hand- I've ten thousand in geid, I'll deck you with jewels while fortune shall smile, Oh no, replied Kate of the Emerald Isle. From my true love Dennis I never will part, He has gained my affections and lives in my heart, Neither diamonds or jewels shall e'en . beguile, While my name's bonny Kate of tho Emerald Ma Then to church they repaired aud the bells they did And the birds in the bushes did merrily sing ring, In a neat little cottage young Dennis did smile On his bonny young Kate of the Emerald Isle. irt dF . j f s , i_ 9g tSi s v.Jw xg?m TUB f?™ S,a.beautltul river that springs in the West, With daisy-clad banks and mountains' so reen and purling fiue streams no man can contest, ' ' Where the salmon and trout in plenty are seen the sun from the east the hills doth adorn The lambs sweetly sporting on each pleasant morn, And the huntsman he starts with the hounds and the horn, To chase the bold fox on the banks of the Lee.
