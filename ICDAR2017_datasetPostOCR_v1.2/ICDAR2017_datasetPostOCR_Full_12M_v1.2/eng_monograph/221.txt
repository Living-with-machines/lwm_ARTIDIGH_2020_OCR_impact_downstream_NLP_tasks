Half-afraid, he first Against the window beats then, brisk, alights On the warm hearth then, hopping o'er the floor, Eyes all the smiling family askance, And pecks, and starts, and wonders where he is -Till, more familiar grown, the table-crumbs Attract his slender feet. The foodless wilds Pour forth their brown inhabitants. The hare, Though timorous of heart, and hard beset By death in various forms, dark snares, and dogs, And more unpitying men, the garden seeks, Urged on by fearless want. The bleating kind Eye the bleak heaven, and next the glistening earth, With looks of dumb despair then, sad dispersed, Dig for the withered herb through heaps of snow. 1726. - Thomson's Winter. ccxvn. GRONGAR HILL. Silent nymph, with curious eye, Who, the purple evening, lie On the mountain's lonely van, Beyond the noise of busy man Painting fair the form of things. While the yellow linnet sings Or the tuneful nightingale Charms the forest with her tale Come, with all thy various hues, Come, and aitt thy sister Muse Now, while Phoebus, riding high, Gives lustre to the land and sky ! Grongar Hill invites my song, Draw the landscape bright and strong
