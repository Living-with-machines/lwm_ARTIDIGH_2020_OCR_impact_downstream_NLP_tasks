He walked thro' squares and passed each shop, Of speed he went at the very top Each step he took with a bound and a hop, And found his leg he could not stop. Horror and fright were in his face, The neighbours thought he was running a race He clung to a post to stay his pace, But the leg remorseless kept up the chase.
