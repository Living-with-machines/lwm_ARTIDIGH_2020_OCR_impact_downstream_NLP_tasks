[OCR_toInput] SECT. III. Cleopatra's barge. 101 The fishermen, that walk upon the beach, Appear like mice and yond tall anchoring bark, Diminished to her cock her cock, a buoy Almost too. small for sight the murmuring surge, That on the unnumbered idle pebbles chafes, Cannot be heard so high. - I'll look no more Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight Topple down headlong. - King Lear, iv. 6. LXXXV CLEOPATRA'S BARGE The barge she sat in, like a burnished throne, Burnt on the water the poop was beaten gold Purple the sails, and so perfumed that The winds were love-sick with them the oars were silver Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made The water, which they beat, to follow faster, As amorous of their strokes. For her own person, It beggared all description she did lie In her pavilion - cloth-of-gold, of tissue -O'er-picturing that Venus where we see The fancy out-work nature on each side her Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids, With divers-coloured fans, whose wind did seem To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool, And what they undid, did. Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides, So many mermaids, tender her i' the eyes, And made their bends adornings at the helm A seeming mermaid steers the silken tackle Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands, That yarely frame the office. From the barge A strange invisible perfume hits the sense
