[OCR_toInput] SECT. II.] FROM THE SCHOOL-MISTRESS. 287 Which with pellucid horn secured are, To save from finger wet the letters fair; The work so gay, that on their back is seen, St. George’s high achievements does declare ; On which thilk wight that has y-gazing been, Kens the forthcoming rod, unpleasing sight I ween ! Ah luckless he, and born beneath the beam Of evil star ! it irks me whilst I write ; As erst the bard by Mulla’s silver stream, Oft, as he told of deadly dolorous plight, Sighed as he sung, and did in tears indite. For brandishing the rod, she doth begin To loose the brogues,* the stripling’s late delight! And down they drop ; appears his dainty skin, Fair as the furry coat of whitest ermilin. O ruthful scene ! when from a nook obscure, His little sister doth his peril see ; All playful as she sate, she grows demure ; She finds full soon her wonted spirits flee ; She meditates a prayer to set him free; Nor gentle pardon could this dame deny, (If gentle pardon could with dames agree) To her sad grief that swells in either eye, And wrings her so that all for pity she could die. No longer can she now her shrieks command ; And hardly she forbears, through awful fear, To rushen forth, and, with presumptuous hand, To stay harsh justice in its mid career. On thee she calls, on thee her parent dear! (Ah ! too remote to ward the shameful blow !) * An old word for breeks, trousers ; it occurs in one of Coleridge’s sonnets quoted in his Biographia Literaria, chap. i.
