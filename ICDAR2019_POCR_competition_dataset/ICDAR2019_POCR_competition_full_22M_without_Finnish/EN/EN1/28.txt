I did ; and going did a rainbow note; Surely, thought I, This is the lace of Peace’s coat; I will search out the matter. But while I looked the clouds immediately Did break and scatter. Then went I to a garden and did spy A gallant flower, The crown imperial; sure, said I, Peace at the root must dwell. But when I digged, I saw a worm devour What showed so well. At length I met a reverend good old man ; Whom when for Peace I did demand, he thus began : There was a Prince of old At Salem dwelt, who lived with good increase Of flock and fold. He sweetly lived ; yet sweetness did not save His life from foes. But after death out of his grave There sprang twelve stalks of wheat Which many wondering at, got some of those To plant and set. It prospered strangely, and did soon disperse Through all the earth ; For they that taste it do rehearse That virtue lies therein ; A secret virtue, bringing peace and mirth By flight of sin.
