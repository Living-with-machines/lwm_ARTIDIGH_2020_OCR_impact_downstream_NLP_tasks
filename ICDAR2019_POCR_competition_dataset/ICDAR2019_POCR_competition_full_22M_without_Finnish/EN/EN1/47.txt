The great contrivers of our sad diviffons, which abuse the weake rea‑ fon of the people, to keepe up an   fortunate misunder@ﬆanding between King and Subject are not named by the Rep@li@cant ; but they are clearely pointed out to be the Chi@efe Lords and Commons in Parliament : for he saith, Every new Vote of late hath been a new a@ ﬂiction : a@nd he makes Pennington and the Citty Lecturers to be but Iourney‐men R@ebe@ls under them : and even this Hellish flander he venteth under the name of the Petitioners, whem he stiles the most conffderable persons of the Citty : and at the@ same time a@@ﬃrmeth,that the people generally are of hon@est a@ﬀections. And the Answer to the Petition in which@@,t@he words (he saies) are softer then oyle , though the matter of it be poison of A@@es, he attributes only to some C@hiefe Engineers of mischiefe in the House, though it carry in it the Authority of the whole House. Here is a wonder be‑ yond all wonders. A few factious persons i@n Parliament over‐awe the ma‑ jor, better and wiser part in Parliament ; and by a few factious Instruments in Citty and Count@re@y abuse @the major,better and wiser part there also into the most miserable distempers and calamities that ever were ; and though the honest generality begin to gro@w wiser and are instructed by the sence of their miseries, and by other advertisements from loyall Papi@ﬁs and Prelate@s, and other pious Courtiers and souldiers to shake o@ﬀ their few Tormentors : Nay , and though the King himself has not onely publisht the most eloquent and subtill Declarations to disabuse t@he people , that ever were (himselfe be‑ ing the most beloved and honoured Prince that ever was for his indulgence to Liberty and Religion) but ha h also advanced a most puissant and victo‑ rious Army to tele ve these undeceived wretches; yet the incantation holds, no humane force either of A@rmes or Arts can dissolve it. The miracles of @@@Moses had an impre@@on of divine vertue upon them, and did@ therefore tri‑ umph over all the Egyptians spels : but in this case, M@r Pym, with I know not what infernall engines distorts and wrests all the Orbes of a Kingdome@ from their naturall motions ; and yet no divine Art can reffst him. ' was ne‑ ver beleev'd before that any but God could work contrary to nature, but now it must be beleeved. But is it so apparent that the Parliament is averse from peace ? yet saies the Replicant, For withdraw the fuell, and the @ﬁre is soon extinguisht : Let the @Parliament not foment the ill humour (@by supplyes of men, Armes and A@mmu@nition@)and the wound will he@ale of it selfe. In the pe‑ tition, nothing but an Accommodation, safe and honourable was pretended, but now we see a meere submi@@on is intended in this replication@. T s not prooved : That the Ar@mes of the Parliament are unjust; 'tis not prooved;that it may be safe for the Kingdome to prostrate, and subject Par‑ liaments to the discretion of that faction which now has bereav'd us of the Kings presence and favour, yet because the Replicant will take upon him to    demne Parliaments; we must also allow of his Judgement. what the Replicant hath set forth, wee shall now see in the same order.
