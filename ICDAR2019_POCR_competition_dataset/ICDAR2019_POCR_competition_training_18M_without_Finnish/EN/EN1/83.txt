[OCR_toInput] 43 2 AN ENGLISH ANTHOLOGY. [BK. IV. CCCXXXIV. THE BURIAL OF SIR JOHN MOORE.* Not a drum was heard, not a funeral note, As his corpse to the rampart we hurried; Not a soldier discharged his farewell shot O’er the grave where our hero we buried. We buried him darkly at dead of night, The sods with our bayonets turning; By the struggling moonbeam’s misty light, And the lantern dimly burning. No useless coffin enclosed his breast, Not in sheet nor in shroud we wound him; But he lay like a warrior taking his rest, With his martial cloak around him. f Few and short were the prayers we said, And we spoke not a word of sorrow; But we steadfastly gazed on the face that was dead, And we bitterly thought of the morrow. We thought, as we hollowed his narrow bed, And smoothed down his lonely pillow, That the foe and the stranger would tread o’er his head, And we far away on the billow ! Lightly they’ll talk of the spirit that’s gone, And o'er his cold ashes upbraid him,— But little he’ll reck, if they let him sleep on In the grave where a Briton has laid him. * First published anonymously in the Newry Telegraph, 1817. f ‘ A question arose as to which was the most perfect ode that had been produced. Shelley contended for Coleridge’s On Switzer land; others named some of Moore’s Melodies, and Campbell’s Hohenlinden. Lord Byron said, “ I will show you an ode I consider little inferior to the best which the present prolific age has produced ”.
