[OCR_toInput] AN ENGLISH ANTHOLOGY. [BK. II. 138 A suit of durance let it be, For all weathers ; that for me, For the land or for the sea, Lasting evermore. Winter’s cold or summer’s heat, Autumn’s tempests on it beat, It can never know defeat, Never can rebel. Such the love that I would gain, Such the love, I tell thee plain, Thou must give, or woo in vain ; So to thee farewell. —Anonymous. CXVIII. ON HIS BEING ARRIVED AT THE AGE OF TWENTY- THREE. How soon hath Time, the subtle thief of youth, Stolen on his wing my three-and-twentieth year! My hasting days fly on with full career, But my late spring no bud or blossom sheweth. Perhaps my semblance might deceive the truth That I to manhood am arrived so near; And inward ripeness doth much less appear, That some more timely-happy spirits endueth.* Yet, be it less or more, or soon or slow, It shall be still in strictest measure even To that same lot, however mean or high, Toward which Time leads me, and the will of Heaven ; All is, if I have grace to use it so, As ever in my great Task-Master’s eye. 1631. —Milton, Sonnet 2. * In 1628, Cowley, when ten years of age, had written Pyramus and Thisbc, an ethical romance.
