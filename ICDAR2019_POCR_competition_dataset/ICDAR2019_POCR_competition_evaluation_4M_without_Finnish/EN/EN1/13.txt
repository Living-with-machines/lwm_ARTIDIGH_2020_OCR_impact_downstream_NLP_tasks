[OCR_toInput] 43+ AN ENGLISH ANTHOLOGY. [bk. IV. CCCXXXVI. KUBLA KHAN:* A VISION IN A DREAM. In Xanadu did Kubla Khan A stately pleasure-dome decree, Where Alph, the sacred river, ran Through caverns measureless to man Down to a sunless sea. So twice five miles of fertile ground With walls and towers were girdled round ; And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree; And here were forests ancient as the hills, Enfolding sunny spots of greenery. But oh ! that deep romantic chasm which slanted Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover! A savage place! as holy and enchanted As e’er beneath a waning moon was haunted By woman wailing for her demon-lover ! And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething, As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing, A mighty fountain momently was forced ; Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail, Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher’s flail; And ’mid these dancing rocks at once and ever It flung up momently the sacred river. Five miles meandering with a mazy motion * The author fell asleep in his chair at the moment he was reading the following from Purchas’ Pilgrims : ‘ Here the Khan Kubla com manded a palace to be built, and a stately garden thereunto, and thus ten miles of fertile ground were enclosed with a wall ’.
