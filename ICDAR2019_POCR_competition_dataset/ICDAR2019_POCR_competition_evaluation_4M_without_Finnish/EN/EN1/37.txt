It extends only to all possible things, replied the Lutherans. By God in heaven, cried the Popish doctors, he can make a nose, if he thinks fit, as big as the steeple of Strasburg. Now the steeple of Strasburg being the big gest and the tallest church-steeple to be seen in the whole world, the Antinosarians denied that a nose of 575 geometrical feet in length could be worn, at least by a middle-sized man The Popish doctors swore it could The Lutheran doctors said no ; it could not. This at once started a new dispute, which they pursued a great way upon the extent and limita tion os the moral and natural attributes of God —That controversy led them naturally into Thomas Aquinas, and Thomas Aquinas to the devil. The stranger’s nose was no more heard of in the dispute—it just served as a frigate to launch them into the gulph of fchool-divinity,.—ar.d then they all sailed before the wind. Heat is in proportion to the want of true knowledge. The controversy about the attributes, &c in stead of cooling, en the contrary had inflamed the Strafourgers imaginations to a most inordi nate degree—The less they understood of the matter, the greater was their wonder about it — they were left in all the distresses of desire un satisfied.
